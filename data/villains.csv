,,Villains,United Nations,,Conrad,(designed UN),"Appropriately, Le Corbusier’s first view of New York was from his liner while it was anchored in quarantine. He sees it from within a sanitary cordonand admires its gelid beauty. Disembarking, he finds it to be carnally real and repellent. Before he can approve of it, it must be pristinely repackaged, insulated from the bacterial atmosphere. He commends the cellophane casing of sandwiches, the polished bar tops, and the trains in Grand Central, which are kept spick and span by legions of black janitors. But the apogee of his cleansed and hermetically sealed New York is Radio City, where he goes with Léger to make a broadcast. As its name proclaims, it’s a city within— and immunized against—the city. It’s installed “in one of the skyscrapersof Rockefeller Center,” safe from the savage, infested outdoors. He likes the claustral hush of its elevators and corridors and gratefully breathesits filtered and tempered air. Radio City is one of his bloodless cathedrals. Inside the studio he sees another room made by muting and insulation: a glass aquarium for spectators, who can chatter at will without being heard because their booth is soundproofed. ",,

Moses did his best to raise himself to gigantic stature, and even came to enjoy his increasing reputation as a monster, which he believed would intimidate the public and keep potential opponents out of the way.","He appeared as the latest in a long line of titanic builders and destroyers,

,,Villains,"Noguchi Museum, United Nations Playground",,Walrod,,"Moses hated Isamu Noguchi. In 1952, the artist was commissioned to create a privately-funded, sculptured playground for the United Nations building on city property which was given a special international diplomatic designation. All parties were a go until Moses stepped in and criticized the design as little more than a “rabbit warren.” He went so far as to threaten to not install the guard rail facing the East River to force the project’s abandonment.",,

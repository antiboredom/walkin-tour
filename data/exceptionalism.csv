,,Exceptionalism,29-33 W 42nd St (3rd Floor),,Allen and Brickman,"Gershwin premiered Rhapsody in Blue on February 12, 1924 at Aeolian Hall in New York City","And the “Rhapsody in Blue” orchestration swells. The film cuts to a magnificent skyline of Manhattan, the early-morning sun casting it almost in silhouette; the sun sets in another, a different, skyline, and, finally, Manhattan is shown at night, its buildings and bridges illuminated with thousands of lights. “Rhapsody in Blue” reaches a crescendo as the film cuts to a black background, white credits popping on and off the screen.",,

total work of an era. The yardstick by which his public housing and Title 1 feats can best be measured, for example, is the Age of Skyscrapers, which reared up the great masses of stone and steel and concrete over Manhattan in quality comparable to his. The yardstick by which the influence of his highways can be gauged is the Age of Railroads. But Robert Moses did not build only housing projects and highways. Robert Moses built parks and playgrounds and beaches and parking lots and cultural centers and civic centers and a United Nations Building and a Shea Stadium and a Lincoln Center and the mid-city campuses of four separate universities. He was a shaper not of sections of a city but of a city. He was, for the greatest city in the Western world, the city shaper, the only city shaper. In sheer physical impact on New York and the entire metropolitan region, he is comparable not to the works of any man or group of men or even generations of men. In the shaping of New York, Robert Moses was comparable only to some elemental force of nature.<br><br>But if in the shaping of New York, Robert Moses was an elemental force, he was also a blind force: blind and deaf to reason, to argument, to new ideas, to any ideas except his own.",

The odds that partygoing Manhattanites are more likely to have dined, drunk, and danced in boîtes in London, Paris, St. Moritz, Miami, and Los Angeles than in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island bounce off the scale.<br><br>Manhattanites have a whole xenophobic repertoire to deal with humans who happen to dwell in the outer boroughs. They mock their accents, deplore their dress codes, and have names for them—BBQs (for Brooklyn, Bronx, and Queens), Bridge and Tunnels (for the ways in and out of the city), and 718s (for the Brooklyn and Queens area codes.) In <i>Saturday Night Fever</i> John Travolta’s arrival in Manhattan is depicted as though a Neanderthal were suddenly to find himself stumbling among Homo sapiens, and Melanie Griffith, the commuter from Staten Island in <i>Working Girl</i>, is shown sporting her big hair, leather coat, and lots of jewelry, like the totems of some peculiar tribe.",

Over these the tower; topped by a pyramid and a single glorified chimney which streams a plume of smoke line incense, and flanked by four obelisks. The group of which this tower is the crown creates an illusion not uncommon among the building-masses of Manhattan. It seems impossible to believe that one is not beholding a splendid hill-city, like the Acropolis ... There is another view of this group even more stirring to the imagination; but to see it as its best, you must pick your day and hour. Some morning when the skies are overcast and the air is perfectly still, goto Telegram Square under the elevated, put your back to the westward walls, and look up again. The tower with its obelisks just peeps above the bizarre elevated structure and the roofs to eastward. All the lower buildings about it are streaming columns of white smoke against the violet-gray skies. It seems then like the exalted altar of some strange rite; an altar beyond the conception of man—raised by the gods to a greater god.”",

,21&22,Exceptionalism,,,Bender,,,"Duchamp, on arriving in New York in 1913, declared “New York is itself a work of art, a complete work of art.” Europe, he thought, was finished. This view was shared by Francis Picabia: “New York,” he famously declared in 1913, “is the cubist city, the futurist city. It expresses in its architecture, its life, its spirit, the modern thought.”",

Skyscrapers were then living things. Today, for a Frenchman arriving from Europe, they are already mere historical monuments, witnesses to a bygone age. They still rise up intothe sky but my spirit does not soar with them, and the New Yorkers passby at their feet without so much as a glance. I cannot think of them without melancholy; they speak of an age when we believed in peace. They are already a little run-down; tomorrow, perhaps, they will be demolished. At any rate, to build them took a faith we no longer possess.",

Henry’s book <i>The Voice of the City<i> (1908). In the eponymous lead story the narrator searches all over New York, at night, for “the composite vocal message of massed humanity,” to “interpret its meaning” since “it must have a key.” New York’s voice, O. Henry imagined, would have to be “a mighty and far-reaching utterance ... the tremendous crash of the chords of the day’s traffic, the laughter and music of the night ... the rag-time, the weeping, the stealthy hum of cab-wheels.”",,

The meal started with Gordon-made aspic, went on to oxtail soup, and then the bone platter. Richard Peck was in the back scrubbing bones that people had finished eating and Hisachika Tasahashi drilled holes through the bones, which were stung on rope and handed to the customers as necklaces so they could wear their dinners home.",,

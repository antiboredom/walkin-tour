,,No Pity,10th St and University Place,,Binzen,,"During the Great Garbage Strike, the residents on Tenth between University Place and Fifth Avenue, once their garbage cans were full,put the excess in strangely vulgar-looking see-through plastic bags. But whatever their appearance, they were effective, and the sidewalks remained clean.<br><br>Further east on Tenth Street the garbage just piled higher and higher in great smelly pyramids that soon threatened to engulf entire city blocks inas pungent and surrealistic a happening as this city ever held. One night, between Avenues B and C, someone started throwing his slop out of the window. This immediately developed into a block project. Two hours later that section of Tenth Street was ankle-high in wall-to-wall garbage. It proved to be a swift and altogether satisfying solution to the problem, though, for the city saw fit to remove the mess during the night, and the next morning that block was cleaner than it had ever been before.",,
,,No Pity,"1 Ferry Terminal Viaduct, Staten Island",,Trebay,,"The joke on Hylan Boulevard last week went that if you held a syringe to your ear, you could hear the ocean. Beginning with a high tide over the previous weekend, medical waste had been washing up on Staten Island’s shore almost daily. Each new cycle brought fresh harvests of pill bottles, blood vials, and needles. As if that weren’t enough, a city sewage treatment plant overflowed on Thursday and added 20 million gallons of bilge to the nightmare soup.",,
,,No Pity ,28 Allen,,"Sanders, Beatnik",,"He located an apartment at 28 Allen Street, a few blocks south of Houston. It was a typical two-room tub-in-the-kitchen slum apartment painted dogtongue green. The human who had previously lived there had somehow causedthe walls to become streaked with long lines of gray brown grease furry to the touch because of the trapped soot. The plaster was tumbling from the ceiling and the front window, opening on Allen Street, had been based inand replaced with the door of a cigarette vending machine. What a crummy apartment.",,

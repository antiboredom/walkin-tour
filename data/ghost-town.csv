In front of every train, to warn pedestrians and drives, rode a cowboy on a horse, waving a large red flag. Since the trains came at frequent intervals and moved extremely slowly along the avenue, traffic was frequently backed up for blocks. Often, a driver would become impatient and ignore the warning flag. For that reason, Eleventh had become known as “Death Avenue.” For years, the city had tried without success to find a solution to the problem posed by the presence of the railroad along the West Side.",,

But much of the rest of New York looked similar—beaten up and exhausted by hard use.<br><br>This comes out most poignantly in photographic records of Greenwich Village. The streets are void of traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian: parking spaces abound; the signs are handmade and amateurish. Café and restaurant interiors resemble grammar school classrooms, a clutter of junk and a creativity more childish than avant-garde. Exteriors seem forgotten, embalmed: in a 1960 photo of the White Horse Tavern on Hudson Street, now a sidewalk café overrun by models and stockbrokers, looks like what it then really was: a seedy bar on the corner of fire escapes and walkup apartments.",

But not impossible.,"It’s difficult to see in the Manhattan of today any trace of that primeval island. But not impossible. Perhaps the place to start is with a pair of trees: two gaunt pines growing close together, just west of Broadway, in the south graveyard of Trinity Church. Almost hidden in the corner between the walls of the church and the sacristy, they’re nearly always in shadow. But at the right time, seen from the right vantage point, they make it possible to imagine the island of the Lenape and the earliest Dutch, surviving spectrally amidst four centuries of development.<br><br>Standing at the corner of Broadway and Rector Street on a clear late winter afternoon, these pines loom starkly against the brown stones of the church. The steeple rises above, and above that an expanse of sky. When darkness falls, the pines sink gradually into the shadows between the church and attached chapel, the spire and the buttress in sharp relief behind. Ignore the skyscrapers (easily done from there) and you see something that would have been there in 1700. In darkness the brownstone church loses its shape: imagine it gone (the original church opened in 1697), multiply the pines in your imagination, and you see it as it was even in 1650—a graveyard, among the earliest in New Amsterdam.",

Eventually, the city filled in the area, built streets, constructed piers. As a result, in 1928 Appleby’s descendants sued the city for trespass, and ultimately received more than three million dollars in awards, interest and damages. They still own the property, which today—largely because of the city’s trespass—is valued at more than 150 times what it cost their ancestor.",,

It was high tide in the wave of self-destruction; 1,595 was the official tally for that year of 1932. A noon-hour crowd filled the Midtown streets. The copper-red sun shone through the blue humid air. For a moment the summertime city hushed, one of those pauses and its roar more imaginary than real. Then, all of a sudden, piercing shrieks volleyed from high office windows. I jerked upward. The cries came from the blanched faces of a great gallery of office girls, sitting at open windows. A gray figure, arms and waved legs waving, were involved in grotesque somersaults. I jumped backward. The body missed me and cleared two young women, a matter of inches—they fell from fright. A worn-thin suit hit the sidewalk near the curb, landing with a bone cracking thud. It flattened as if filled with a huge lump of subsiding putty. A stream of sluggish blood oozed from under its matted gray hair. The cries stopped; a crowd pressed close, whistle screeched. Then, ghastly afterthought, his raffish hat, an old straw skimmer, circled gaily to the street, landing near the bleeding head.",,

,,Ghost Town,1 W 72nd St,,Frisa and Tornchi,,"
I can’t exactly remember when the world stepped out of the underground
and entered the unceasing flux of consensus. It happened, I guess, around
11 o’clock on the evening of December 8, 1980, uptown New York, on the sidewalk in front of the Dakota building. David Mark Chapman, twenty-five years old, from Hawaii, popped out from the underground of his mind and fired five shots at John Lennon. When Lennon died at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center, the underground ended and the eighties began. The seventies were the subsoil of our culture, maybe not really the sub-soil but only a sad basement, one of those with windows at sidewalk level, from where you can see people’s ankles passing by. The ankle is that part of the body that more than any other reveals how unsexy the seventies were. From the basement the world was seeking out for some form of deliverance. From their ankles the seventies wanted to climb up as far as to the shoulders.<br>Honestly the true underground was finished by the end of the sixties, with the livid turmoil of the 68 movement making mincemeat of it. The seventies, by contrast, were a pimple on the face of Western society. The underground was the smell of cigarette smoke, unmade beds, bodies naked, not bundled up, dark glasses even at night, spend not thrift, personal not collective
risk, vulgarity not malaise, personality not insecurity. The bullets that smacked into John Lennon’s body arrived from the seventies’ awkwardness, shattering what was left over from the sixties. Those bullets made a breach in the sewers of the Western world’s underground, from which it poured out the excessive effluvium of a decade in which success and excess swapped places continually, softening even the hardest dwellers of sewers, cellars and miserable basements.<br><br>...Those who died as losers died twice over in the society of the eighties.",,

Piercing through all that noise was the a-ooga of car horns on the street, the whistle of the ferries that docked in the slips right at the foot of Cortlandt Street, and the much deeper bellow from the tugboats plying the river. There was the occasional clop of horses—in the late 1920s there were still a few horse-drawn drays moving small loads of cargo or scrapwood, and they could be seen negotiating the widest of U-turns at the Cortlandt intersections.",,

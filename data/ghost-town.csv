","In recollections of the 1950s, in films, and in photographs, perhaps the most striking feature of Manhattan that emerges again and again is its emptiness—the abandoned look of even its most important arteries.

Third and Sixth Avenues had the excuse of sudden exposure after decades under the shadow, soot, and screech of their elevated lines. But much of the rest of New York looked similar—beaten up and exhausted by hard use.<br><br>This comes out most poignantly in photographic records of Greenwich Village. The streets are void of traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian: parking spaces abound; the signs are handmade and amateurish. Café and restaurant interiors resemble grammar school classrooms, a clutter of junk and a creativity more childish than avant-garde. Exteriors seem forgotten, embalmed: in a 1960 photo of the White Horse Tavern on Hudson Street, now a sidewalk café overrun by models and stockbrokers, looks like what it then really was: a seedy bar on the corner of fire escapes and walkup apartments.",

","The railroad tracks wended their way between the buildings, making several sharp curves, and then emerged on Eleventh Avenue along which, at street level, trains inched their way in a straight line down to the foot of the island. In front of every train, to warn pedestrians and drives, rode a cowboy on a horse, waving a large red flag. Since the trains came at frequent intervals and moved extremely slowly along the avenue, traffic was frequently backed up for blocks. Often, a driver would become impatient and ignore the warning flag. For that reason, Eleventh had become known as “Death Avenue.” For years, the city had tried without success to find a solution to the problem posed by the presence of the railroad along the West Side.",,

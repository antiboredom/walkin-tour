Shortly after the program began, one of the birds mistook a pet Chihuahua as its lunch. The program has since been terminated. ","And then there is a whole race of pigeon and squirrel feeders, whose generosity stuffs to bursting the gluttons in parks and public places. These scatterers of grain may not all be lonely people, of course, but they give the impression that the pigeons and the squirrels fill a large part of their lives. I never see an elderly lady toting a bag of earnestly collected crumbs and crusts to her part-time pets that I do not reflect on the injustice of the situation. These gentle ladies, feeding the never-satiated birds, make me feel that it would be far better if the situation were reversed. A nice roast pigeon would make a nourishing meal for one of these kind women and Iâ€™d be willing to do something about it. A squirrel pie would fatten and redden the pale cheeks of elderly gentlemen who doubtless deprive themselves of small comforts to feed those ungrateful gray rodents, the squirrels. Pigeons and squirrels give these lonely people the illusion of being needed and loved.",,

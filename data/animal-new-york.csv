Shortly after the program began, one of the birds mistook a pet Chihuahua as its lunch. The program has since been terminated. ","And then there is a whole race of pigeon and squirrel feeders, whose generosity stuffs to bursting the gluttons in parks and public places. These scatterers of grain may not all be lonely people, of course, but they give the impression that the pigeons and the squirrels fill a large part of their lives. I never see an elderly lady toting a bag of earnestly collected crumbs and crusts to her part-time pets that I do not reflect on the injustice of the situation. These gentle ladies, feeding the never-satiated birds, make me feel that it would be far better if the situation were reversed. A nice roast pigeon would make a nourishing meal for one of these kind women and I’d be willing to do something about it. A squirrel pie would fatten and redden the pale cheeks of elderly gentlemen who doubtless deprive themselves of small comforts to feed those ungrateful gray rodents, the squirrels. Pigeons and squirrels give these lonely people the illusion of being needed and loved.",,

a drop of sailor's blood;<br>
under the additions, a river of tender blood.<br>
A river that sings and flows<br>
past bedrooms in the boroughs -<br>
and it's money, cement, or wind<br>
in New York's counterfeit dawn.<br>
I know the mountains exist.<br>
And wisdom's eyeglasses,<br>
too. But I didn't come to see the sky.<br>
I'm here to see the clouded blood,<br>
the blood that sweeps machines over waterfalls<br>
and the soul toward the cobra's tongue.<br>Every day in New York, they slaughter<br>
four million ducks,<br>
five million hogs,<br>
two thousand pigeons to accommodate the tastes of the dying, one million cows,<br>
one million lambs,<br>
and two million roosters<br>
that smash the sky to pieces.<br>

It's better to sob while honing a blade<br>
or kill dogs on the delirious hunts<br>
than to resist at dawn<br>

the endless blood trains<br>
and the trains of roses, manacled<br>
by the dealers in perfume.<br>

who ignores the other half,<br>
the half that can't be redeemed,<br>
who lift their mountains of cement<br>
where the hearts beat<br>
inside forgotten little animals<br>
and where all of us will fall<br>
in the last feast of pneumatic drills.<br>
I spit in all your faces.<br>
The other half hears me,<br>
devouring, pissing, flying in their purity,<br>
like the supers' children in lobbies<br>
who carry fragile twigs<br>
to the emptied spaces where<br>
the insect antennae are rusting.<br>
This is not hell, but the street.<br>
Not death, but the fruit stand.<br>
There is a world of tamed rivers and distances just beyond our grasp<br>
in the cat's paw smashed by a car,<br>
and I hear the earthworm's song<br>
in the hearts of many girls.<br>
Rust, fermentation, earth tremor.<br>
<br><br>
You yourself are the earth as you drift in office numbers.<br>
What shall I do now? Set the landscapes in order?<br>
Order the loves that soon become photographs,<br>
that soon become pieces of wood and mouthfuls of blood?<br>
No, no: I denounce it all.<br>
I denounce the conspiracy<br>
of these deserted offices<br>
that radiate no agony,<br>
that erase the forest's plans,<br>
and I offer myself as food for the cows wrung dry<br>
when their bellowing fills the valley<br>
where the Hudson gets drunk on oil.<br>",

On March 1977, Cheever appeared on the cover of Newsweek with the caption, ""A Great American Novel: John Cheever's <i>Falconer</i>."" ","My father was writing stories for <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine and hoping that one day he would be able to write a novel. He was an artist, but he liked to keep up appearances. In the morning he got dressed in a business suit from Brooks Brothers with a rep tie and felt hat with a grosgrain band and rode down in our building elevator with all the other men dressed the same way on their way to work. They got off at the first floor and left the building through the lobby on their way to Wall Street and midtown. My father crossed the lobby and walked down the back stairs to the basement, where he wrote all day in a windowless storage room in his boxer shorts, with his suit carefully hung against the wall.

Weberman, popularizer of the terms ""garbology"" and ""Dylanology,"" is best known for his controvertial opinions on, and personal interactions with, Bob Dylan. <i>Rolling Stone</i> called Weberman ""the kink of all Dylan nuts."" ","One day in September, 1970, Ann Duncan and I were on our way to the
Cafe Gaslight on MacDougal Street and we happened to pass Bob Dylan’s townhouse. For four long years I had been studying Dylan’s poetry, trying
to crack the code of his symbolism. As I eyed the home of the reclusive poet
I wondered what went down behind the door that Dylan had slammed in my face when I had tried to discuss my work with him. Just then I noticed Dylan’s shiny new steel garbage can. My mind flashed back to a Lord Buckley riff from Johanna and Whale: “I ain’t outside anymore, I’m inside now.” and said to myself, “Now, there’s something that was inside and it’s outside now.” I lifted the lid, I opened Pandora’s can, I reached in and the first thing, THE FIRST THING, that I pulled out of Dylan’s garbage was a half-finished letter written by Bob Dylan to Johnny Cash. “Holy Moley,” I said, “Ann, this is no ordinary garbage-can, this is a gold mine!”<br><br>After my initial discovery in Dylan’s garbage I realized that this method of research had great potential as a clandestine method. The lives of the rich, famous and powerful could be penetrated, great secrets revealed, plain truths brought to light from beneath the glittery facade. Garbology was a new
 weapon in the war against lies, injustice and faceless bureaucracy. The study and analysis of garbage could possibly alter the course of history! I resolved at once that aided by this valuable science I would leave no stone unturned, no garbage can lid unturned, in my quest for truth.

small hospital, rehearsal rooms, a gymnasium, an art department,
costume workshops. There is Radio City Symphony and a permanent
troupe of 64 female dancers—the Roxyettes, all between 5’4” and 5’7”—a scriptless chorus line without any action to sustain. Furthermore, there
is a menagerie—horses, cows, goats and other animals. They live in ultramodern stables, artificially lit and ventilated; an animal elevator— dimensioned to carry even elephants—not only deposits them on the stage but also on a special grazing ground on Radio City’s roof. Finally, there is Roxy’s own apartment fitted in between the roof trusses of his theater. It is round, all white plaster and the walls describe a parabola to meet in a domed top. The whole thing is really breathless—vague, spaceless, timeless. Makes you feel like an unhatched chicken looking up at the top of his eggshell. To make the whole thing even more fantastic, there are telephone dials in the walls. When you turn a dial, a red light starts to flash on and off—something to do with radio. But most painfully inactive is the colossal theatrical machine, the most complete mechanical installation in the world, including a revolving stage; three manipulable sections of stage flooring;
a power-driven orchestral dais; a tank; an electrically draped curtain; seventy-five rows of fly lines for its scenery, ten of which are electrically operated; a cyclorama 117 feet by 75; six horns for motion pictures and two motion picture projection sheets; a fountain in the middle of the revolving stage which can be used for water effects while the turntable is in motion;
a public-address system for amplifying speech and producing thunder and wind effects (played from records with fifty-four ribbon type); semi-invisible microphones on the stage, in the footlights, in the orchestra pit and in the sub-basement and an amplifier and six loudspeakers concealed above the proscenium; a monitor system in connection with the public address system which reproduces words spoken on the stage in the projection booths and the director’s office and even in the foyer and lobbies if desired, and which also carries the directions of the stage manager to the dressing rooms and electrical stations; an elaborate lighting system with six motor-operated light bridges over the stage, each 104 feet long, from which lens units and floods can be used for special lighting; eight portable sixteen-floor lighting towers; four spotting galleries, two on each side of the stage, and a spotting booth in the auditorium ceiling; a cyclorama strip in the floor and a floor battery of self-leveling, disappearing footlights; six projection machines, four effect machines and the usual, or rather more than usual, complication of controls.",

It’s not a weighted, completed, obstructive thing, but a field of forces distributed through space. Not planted in earth, it unfolds in air, and the logic of its design suggests a similar engineering of society and history: man would be released from his servitude to material forces if only those forces could be operated on, directed, articulated. The bridge is built in time as much as in space. It’s a passage into the future as well as a conduit across a river. Mayakovsky sees it as a prehensile predator, standing with one steel leg in Manhattan while extending a paw to grip Brooklyn. ",
,238&239,x,,,"Morris, Incredible",,"The Brooklyn Bridge’s arches’ interiors are damp, gloomy vaults and are weirdly medieval in appearance, especially the abandoned wine cellars behind the studded heavy steel doors in the arch at North William Street, just off the rear of the old World Building. The arches and the crooked little streets that bend and twist around them give that part of town something of the look of medieval Prague. When you get down into the wine cellars and away from the sound, you’re in a “Cast of Amontillado” setting. The damp drips, walls glitter, footfalls echo, shadows distort on ancient vaults.There’s a brief history of the bridge wine cellars on one of the deep inner walls. It’s patchy and flaked, with painted vine trellises all around it crawling up the wet walls. It says: “Legend of Oechs Cellars: These cellars were built in 1876, about seven years prior to the official opening of Brooklyn Bridge in 1883. From their inception they housed the choicest wines in New York City.” ",,

Repeating their morning vow;<br>

To resume their compulsory game:<br>
Who can release them now,<br>
Who can reach the deaf,<br>
Who can speak for the dumb?<br>

All I have is a voice<br>
To undo the folded lie,<br>
The romantic lie in the brain<br>
Of the sensual man-in-the-street<br>
And the lie of Authority<br>
Whose buildings grope the sky:<br>
There is no such thing as the State<br>
And no one exists alone;<br>
Hunger allows no choice<br>
To the citizen or the police;<br>
We must love one another or die.<br>
<br><br>
Defenceless under the night<br>
Our world in stupor lies;<br>
Yet, dotted everywhere,<br>
Ironic points of light<br>
Flash out wherever the Just<br>
Exchange their messages:<br>
May I, composed like them<br>
Of Eros and of dust,<br>
Beleaguered by the same<br>
Negation and despair,<br>
Show an affirming flame.<br>

,,x,215 W 57th St = NY School of Art,,Conrad,,"Sloan’s subway etching sees paint as a sensual lubricant. But it’s alsodirt. The painter is a licensed mess-maker. Sloan can enjoy the soiledand stained reality of New York because his own profession contributesto that festal grime. When writing his diary, he takes pleasure in his new fountain pen “which is making these marks” and sullying the paper. Withthe same comically scatological thrill, he records having taken deliveryof an expressed box of printing ink. Part of Robert Henri’s teaching was a messy and incontinent liberation of pigment. His students were taught to be unashamed of the filth they dabbled in, just as they were unembarrassed by urban ugliness. At the New York School of Art on West 57th Street they flung the leftovers from their palettes at a wall, which soon became impasted with an iridescent murk. Sloan concedes the alliance between paint and dirt when, on a walk through the East Side slums in 1906, he comments that the “grimy and greasy door frames” of the tenements look “as though huge hogs covered with filth had worn the paint away and replaced it with matted dirt.” Here paint and dirt compete, but they’re allies all the same. Paint is the accretion of sentiment, the varnishing of age and affection; dirt, too, testifies to use, wear, long familiarity. Dirt, like the spot on Yeats’s vest, vouches for the reality of things, as paint is trying to do. One of Sloan’s pictures—his scrubwoman in the Astor Library in 1910—shows the city being scoured and cleaned. Yet the artist undoes the woman’s labor by muddying the scene all over again in paint.",,

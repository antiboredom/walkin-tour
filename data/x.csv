Auden ","Auden wrote this poem in the first days of World War II in a New York City gay bar. E. M. Forster, in awe of ""September 1, 1939"" upon publication writes, ""Because he once wrote 'We must love one another or die' he can command me to follow him.""  ","I sit in one of the dives<br>
On Fifty-second Street<br>
Uncertain and afraid<br>
","I sit in one of the dives<br>
On Fifty-second Street<br>
Uncertain and afraid<br>
<br><br>
As the clever hopes expire<br>
Of a low dishonest decade:<br>
Waves of anger and fear<br>
Circulate over the bright <br>
And darkened lands of the earth,<br>
Obsessing our private lives;<br>
The unmentionable odour of death<br>
Offends the September night.<br>
<br><br>
Accurate scholarship can <br>
Unearth the whole offence<br>
From Luther until now<br>
That has driven a culture mad,<br>
Find what occurred at Linz,<br>
What huge imago made<br>
A psychopathic god:<br>
I and the public know<br>
What all schoolchildren learn,<br>
Those to whom evil is done<br>
Do evil in return. <br>
<br><br>
Exiled Thucydides knew<br>
All that a speech can say<br>
About Democracy,<br>
And what dictators do,<br>
The elderly rubbish they talk<br>
To an apathetic grave;<br>
Analysed all in his book,<br>
The enlightenment driven away,<br>
The habit-forming pain,<br>
Mismanagement and grief:<br>
We must suffer them all again.<br>
<br><br>
Into this neutral air<br>
Where blind skyscrapers use<br>
Their full height to proclaim<br>
The strength of Collective Man,<br>
Each language pours its vain<br>
Competitive excuse:<br>
But who can live for long<br>
In an euphoric dream;<br>
Out of the mirror they stare,<br>
Imperialism’s face<br>
And the international wrong.<br>
<br>
Faces along the bar<br>
Cling to their average day:<br>
The lights must never go out,<br>
The music must always play,<br>
All the conventions conspire <br>
To make this fort assume<br>
The furniture of home;<br>
Lest we should see where we are,<br>
Lost in a haunted wood,<br>
Children afraid of the night<br>
Who have never been happy or good.<br>
<br><br>
The windiest militant trash<br>
Important Persons shout<br>
Is not so crude as our wish:<br>
What mad Nijinsky wrote<br>
About Diaghilev<br>
Is true of the normal heart;<br>
For the error bred in the bone<br>
Of each woman and each man<br>
Craves what it cannot have,<br>
Not universal love<br>
But to be loved alone.<br>
<br><br>
From the conservative dark<br>
Into the ethical life<br>
The dense commuters come,<br>
Repeating their morning vow;<br>
“I will be true to the wife,<br>
I’ll concentrate more on my work,""<br>
And helpless governors wake<br>
To resume their compulsory game:<br>
Who can release them now,<br>
Who can reach the deaf,<br>
Who can speak for the dumb?<br>
<br><br>
All I have is a voice<br>
To undo the folded lie,<br>
The romantic lie in the brain<br>
Of the sensual man-in-the-street<br>
And the lie of Authority<br>
Whose buildings grope the sky:<br>
There is no such thing as the State<br>
And no one exists alone;<br>
Hunger allows no choice<br>
To the citizen or the police;<br>
We must love one another or die.<br>
<br><br>
Defenceless under the night<br>
Our world in stupor lies;<br>
Yet, dotted everywhere,<br>
Ironic points of light<br>
Flash out wherever the Just<br>
Exchange their messages:<br>
May I, composed like them<br>
Of Eros and of dust,<br>
Beleaguered by the same<br>
Negation and despair,<br>
Show an affirming flame.<br>

I leaned to catch the words he said<br>
      That were light as a snowflake falling;<br>
Ah well that he never leaned to hear<br>
      The words my heart was calling.<br><br>

And on we walked and on we walked<br>
      Past the fiery lights of the picture shows —<br>
Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by<br>
      On the errand each man knows.<br><br>

And on we walked and on we walked,<br>
      At the door at last we said good-bye;<br>
I knew by his smile he had not heard<br>
      My heart's unuttered cry.<br><br>

With the man I love who loves me not<br>
      I walked in the street-lamps' flare —<br>
But oh, the girls who ask for love<br>
      In the lights of Union Square.<br>",
,,x,,,“Wall Street - Greed Is Good” <i>American Rhetoric</i>,,"The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed—for lack of a better word—is good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms—greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge —has marked the upward surge of mankind.

,,? (personal brand),Ogilvy & Mather @ 636 11th Ave (now closed),,Cracknell ,David Ogilvy,"Ogilvy was English, at a time when an English accent was still rare and hugely prized in New York. Ogilvy’s was “a particularly well-modulated accent, and with his long, lean figure, foppish hair and ever present pipe, he was every bit Hollywood’s idea of the perfect English gentleman, a character he fully exploited ... He dressed for his parts. He didn’t wear a business suit. Sometimes he dressed as the English country gentleman with his brogues, a tweed jacket and lapels on his vest. Sometimes he wore a kilt, before anyone had seen one. Sometimes, at big state occasions, he put on this kind of purple vest that looked vaguely ecclesiastical. But he never wore a normal business suit, never ... In that era in New York, where in the face of the brash, loud, busy new world he retreats into a caricature of his real self and becomes even more English, brittle and refined.”",,

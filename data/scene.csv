The East Side bars tended to be dressy, and their customers were conservatively dressed in bow ties, blazers, or fluffy sweaters. The “bird bars” usually started coming to life between eleven-thirty and midnight when the plays let out. Often the men in the bar could be found shoulder to shoulder dancing, singing tunes from such Broadway musicals as South Pacific or Kiss Me, Kate in unison with the jukebox.",

At one event, Cleopatra arrived on a ceremonial float flanked by six servants waving white, glittering palm leaves; and at another, a 2,000-watt incandescent lamp was lit just as a fashion model flung open her Mylar-lined feathered coat, leaving the front rows momentarily blind.

The negro homosexuals still appear at intervals dressed in a baffling impersonation of their opposite sex. Sometimes a “Drag” (or costume ball) is announced ... The raised stubble of chin and neck is pitted with a power that creates a blue bloom. The row of pearls accentuates, rather than camouflages, the Adam’s apple. Kid gloves cover the veined hands, but the feet are always a “give-away.”

Voguing evolved into a contorted, jerky, slicing style of dance when drag queens incorporated kung fu aesthetics into their routines, having become familiar with the swift, angular movements of Bruce Lee and his co-stars while working trade inside Times Square’s porn cinemas, or heading there after a night’s work to get some rest.				
<br><br>
In broad daylight, voguers headed to the abandoned stretches of the West Side piers, where they would hang out and practice moves, or to the clandestine space of gay-driven dance venues such as Better Days, the Paradise Garage and Tracks.
<br><br>					
Beautiful femme queens and famous voguers, taken in their youth. Founding mothers Dorian Corey, Pepper LaBeija, Avis Pendavis, Angie Xtravaganza, Paris Dupree, Duchess LaWong.

In the early 1980s, leaving my house to go to balls at 3:30am was really just a bit too much. My family argued with me about going out, they were like, “Are you crazy? Where you going at this time?” And I would reply, “I’m leaving Brooklyn, riding the West Side Highway up to Harlem, looking at the sunrise, and then I’m going to a ball.” It was like a drug, you had to go, and you had to wait to the end for the grand prize. It was like, “You have to see Miss Avis come out there, honey.”
<br><br>					
Not because I didn’t appreciate the Harlem Renaissance or my roots, I just didn’t like that 4 o’clock, 5 o’clock in the morning lifestyle. It almost felt to
me like it was as if gay people shouldn’t be seen, so let’s go out in the wee hours of the morning and play around and do our thing, then run home before people can see us. I think it was a little safer for some of the drag queens back then, because they liked coming out when it was dark. But when they came downtown, I picked an area where people could feel safe, wear their fur coats and didn’t have to worry about this, that and the other.
<br><br>					
I walked in Brooklyn, in the worst neighborhoods, in red leather pants, red leather shoes, beige sheepskin, beige shoes, finger-wave hairstyle and Gazelle glasses.

Light versus dark for butch queen face.

The top voguers were Ronald LeMay, Jose Xtravaganza, Jason Overness, Aldona Fields, Jerome Pendavis, and Brian Omni.

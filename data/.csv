,,?,,,Bladford,,"In summer, people do not dress for those whom they are off to meet but for those whom they might get to know along the way. It becomes a city of bright plumage, of exotic creatures dipping and diving along the sidewalks, each flashing colour and consciousness. If there are any drab, mousy relics of good taste, garbed in discreet and sensible cottons, they vanish into concrete undergrowth. Summer in Manhattan is a neon moment that dazzles and delights. ",,

After a year or so of slamming away at the modern “Kleenex box” school of architecture, Mailer decided to demonstrate the kind of city he thinks architects should be building. Using children’s building blocks with aluminum beams here and there to provide structural support, he built a six-foot sculptural model of his dream city.","In his Brooklyn Heights apartment, Norman Mailer constructed a Lego- block model of his 15,000-unit apartment building in the pure-geometry style International Modernism, as an act of protest.

","Early in 1906 advertisements appear in New York papers announcing “a ground floor chance to share profits” in “the largest steel structure ever erected ... the greatest amusement enterprise in the whole world ... the best real estate venture,” the Globe Tower. It will cost $1,500,000 to erect. The public is urged to invest. The stock will pay 100 percent interest annually. The most voluminous building ever proposed in the history of mankind, it combines in a single gestalt the opposites—needle and sphere, Trylon and Perisphere—that have been the extremes of Manhattan’s formal vocabulary ever since the Latting Observatory and the balloon of the Crystal Palace were juxtaposed in 1853. It is impossible for a globe to be a tower. A sketch illustrating the ad—of a skyline dominated by a blob—reveals the Globe Tower’s concept: the sphere is to be so colossal that simply by resting on the earth it can claim—through the height of its enormous diameter—also tobe a tower, for it is at least “three times as high as the Flatiron building, the present marvel of New York.”",

The empty streets fill suddenly with swift-moving clerks, tellers, stenographers, and office boys pouring from subways, ferries, and elevated trains; while bankers and brokers arrive almost as promptly in chauffeured automobiles or by planes landing at a ramp near the foot of Wall Street.",,

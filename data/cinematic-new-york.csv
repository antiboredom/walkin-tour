,54,Cinematic New York,TBD,,Sanders,,"The skyline view is a kind of proscenium, after all, a metaphoric arch framing everything to come, offering a reassuring familiarity even as it plunges us into a new and unpredictable experience.","The skyline view is a kind of proscenium, after all, a metaphoric arch framing everything to come, offering a reassuring familiarity even as it plunges us into a new and unpredictable experience. How many places are as widely (or instantly) recognizable as New York? Older films sometimes placed a printed title across the view; newer ones rarely do—but in any case the name has always been superfluous. Like Big Ben or the Taj Mahal, the New York skyline is one of the world’s unmistakable icons, thanks in large part to films themselves: each new opening shot trades on—and reinforces—the skyline’s preexisting fame. Unlike those other icons, though, the skyline carries civic as well as national significance, standing for a city as much as (or more than) a country. And unlike the others it is not just a single structure but an entire place—the very thing, in fact, being symbolized. The Eiffel Tower denotes Paris; the skyline not only denotes but is New York.<br><br>Of course, the skyline also denotes something else: the “big city,” the endless metropolis. This turns out to be less a function of the skyline’s vertical thrust, surprisingly, than its horizontal spread: its hundreds upon hundreds of buildings, with their thousands upon thousands of windows— each window providing the symbolic marker of an individual and so, by extension, an individual story. Over the next few hours, the skyline vista suggests, we will follow one such story—but we might well have turned to some other window and there found another, equally interesting story to watch. Next time, perhaps. There are, the skyline proposes, millions of stories to choose from—a whole city of stories, all proceeding at once, whether we happen to see them or not.<br><br>Some establishing shots try for more, searching the skyline for clues about the story to come. The image that starts <i>Young Man with a Horn</i> (1950) gazes high up at the Chrysler Building, soaring into the sky as confidently as the jazz trumpeter on the soundtrack rises into his upper register. But soon the camera begins to tilt down, descending roof by roof to the modest tenement apartment of piano player Hoagy Carmichael, the film’s narrator. This turns out to be a sketch of the film itself—a struggle between the transcendent “high note” that cornetist Kirk Douglas dreams of reaching and the worldly complexities of life and love that threaten to wreck his career. An identical shot, opening <i>Miracle in the Rain</i> (1956), offers a simpler meaning: New York, as the narrator tells us, is home to not only the high and mighty (the skyscrapers) but to millions of ordinary people—including Jane Wyatt, a tenement dweller who is the film’s romantic lead. Barbara Stanwyck’s smoky voice—over at the opening of 1949’s “East Side, West Side” “Yes, this is my town ... the most exciting city in the world, they say, the (glamorous, the most frightening, and above all, the fastest ... ”) underpins a glide from the sleek towers of midtown to a modest apartment house on Gramercy Park (“for me, it’s home”), again evoking the distinction between the celebrated and the ordinary—and the city’s embrace of both.<br><br>The same kind of movement is elsewhere turned to very different purpose. Among other things, the New York skyline remains an abiding symbol
of American wealth and power; an opening that shifts from the gleaming spires to a slum district effectively reminds the audience that the wretched conditions they will be sharing over the next few hours are to be found not in some obscure locality but in proximity to a national landmark. Over time, the simple tilt or pan from proud skyscrapers in the distance to shabby tenements nearby (in <i>Street Scene</i>, 1931, and <i>The Window</i>, 1949) has given way to the ambitious, planimetric aerial shots that open <i>West Side Story</i> (1961) and <i>
New Jack City</i> (1991), which, surveying all part of New York from above—as
if through a giant microscope—imply a kind of social-science objectivity, linking the city’s riches and poorest districts in a single socioeconomic system. ",

,310,Cinematic New York,,,Sharpe,,"In 1910, the famous Roman Chariot Race sign debuted atop the Hotel Normandie at Broadway and Thirty-eighth Street. The thirty-second show, at seven stories high and ninety feet wide, was astonishing enough to stop traffic. Twenty thousand incandescent bulbs gave the impression of toga’d drivers snapping their whips over galloping horses as the wheels of their chariots spun through the night. Like Oscar Wilde at the New York Customs office, the sign had nothing to declare except its own genius. It sold nothing, but advertisers—up to ten in a minute—could bask in the glory of the spectacle by time-sharing a space for their names on the top of the billboard. Chariots came back to Broadway in 1925 when the first neon tubes were used to advertise the movie <i>Ben-Hur.</i>",,

It was only the year before that police had stood by in San Francisco to arrest the Living Theater performers if they so much as started taking their clothes off. Then all of a sudden the new thing was for performers to take all their clothes off and dance around completely naked on stage in long-playing well-advertised shows like <i>Oh!

,164,Cinematic New York,,,Tallack,,"On his visit to New York in 1930, Sergei Eisenstein found numbered streets confusing or else he could not remember addresses full of numbers. And so he attached images to the streets and street corners. He then found that, armed with his images, the rectangular, numerical experience of walking New York, and the shocks and collisions of its intersections, confirmed and refined his theory of cinematic montage.

","One day, probably early in 1980, a film crew commandeered Eleventh Street between Avenues A and B and, with minimal adjustments, returned the block to the way it had looked in 1910. All they did was to pull the plywood coverings off storefront windows, paint names in gold letters on those windows, and pile goods up behind them. They spread straw in the gutters and hung washlines across the street. They fitted selected residents with period clothes and called forth a parade of horse-drawn conveyances. <br><br>When I walked down that street at night, with all the trappings up but the crew absent, I felt like a ghost. The tenements were aspects of the natural landscape, like caves or rock ledges, across which all of us—inhabitants, landlords, dope dealers, beat cops, tourists—flitted for a few seasons, like the pigeons and the cockroaches and the rats, barely registering as individuals in the ceaseless churning of generations.",

,,Cinematic New York,,,Conrad,,"The filming of Dassin’s “The Naked City” is organized with a devious skill worthy of the criminals whose activity it investigates. To allay the suspicions of passersby, diversions are staged: a juggler performs and a man propped on a thirty-foot ladder waves the American flag. Street smart imps relish the way the camera picks the pockets of the citizens by cheating them of their fees as extras. A shoeshine boy remarks to the producer, Mark Hellinger, that the crowd distracted by the juggler “should be getting twenty-five a day for being in the movies and they don’t know it.” Sometimes, while conducting surveillance, the camera unintentionally sees things it shouldn’t—not breaches of the law but incriminating social details which Dassin is forcedto cut from the release print, such as Bowery bums selling off their last possessions outside the Diamond Exchange.

In an era when private-sector labor unions enrolled many more Americans than they do now, and America’s obsessive fear of illegal drugs had not yet taken hold, people cared more about the corruption of unions than they did about gangsters merely killing gangsters, or supplying prostitution or gambling opportunities to those who wanted them.",,

,,Cinematic New York,,,Koolhas,,"Roxy’s understanding of Fantastic Technology inspires a further intensification of his metaphor: questioning the conventional use of the air- conditioning system—ventilation and cooling—he realizes that this would only add chill to the sunset. With the same maniacal logic that characterized his earlier visions, Roxy then considers adding hallucinogenic gases tothe atmosphere of his theater, so that synthetic ecstasy can reinforce the fabricated sunset. A small dose of laughing gas would put the 6,200 visitors in a euphoric mood, hyper-receptive to the activity on the stage. His lawyers dissuade him, but for a short period Roxy actually injects ozone—the therapeutic 03 molecule with its “pungent refreshing odor” and “exhilarating influence”—into the air-conditioning system of his theater. Combining super-time with super-health, Roxy defines the definitive formula of the metropolitan resort with his slogan, “A visit to Radio City Music Hall is as good as a month in the Country.”",,

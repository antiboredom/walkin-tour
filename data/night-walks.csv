,,Night Walks,,,Brox,blackout,"Night was truly night again, just as in the Middle Ages, and, also as in the Middle Ages, light became precious once more. People struck match after match to light their way down flights of stairs: two matches, carefully tended, we’re enough to light the distance between one floor and the next. “Walking down 18 flights to the lobby, we used exactly 36 matches.”...The moonlight lay on the streets like thick snow, and we had a curious, persistent feeling that we were leaving footprints in it. Something was odd about buildings and corners in this beautiful light. The city presented a tilted aspect, and even our fellow pedestrians, chattering with implacable cheerfulness, appeared foreshortened as they passed; they made us think of people running downhill. It was a block more before we understood: The shadows, for once, all fell in the same direction—away from the easterly, all- illuminating moon ... We were in a night forest, and, for a change, home lay not merely uptown but north.",,

,,Night Walks,,,Sharpe,"Names of paintings with nocturnal themes: Sunday Night on 40th Street; Stars on Sixth Avenue; 3 a.m. in the Sun Office; Police Station Lodgers—Madison Street; Easter Eve, Washington Square; Sunset On West 23rd Street Night on the El Train; Night Windows; Nocturne in Grey and Gold: Chelsea Snow.","The light-driven editing of the nocturnal landscape after 1900 effectively dematerialized the night city, destroying any sense of depth or perspective. It became a self-canceling concatenation of messages, an “ethereal abstraction” that in its sheer size and complexity transcended the human capacity for comprehension. Whereas the natural sublime dwarfed and chastened human spectators, and the technological sublime exalted the human mastery of natural forces, this “unintended” electrical sublime of commercial light managed to tear viewers in both directions at once. In so doing, it created a “disembodied spectacle with an alluring promise of personal transformation” that “urged the viewer to merge the scintillating landscape into the self.”",,
,155 & 156,Night Walks,,,Stevens and Swan,,"When beset by his demons, de Kooning would pace the dark streets for most of the night ... walking as far south as Battery Park at the southern tip of the city and then back. Often he went on these prowls alone, but friends occasionally accompanied him. Denby said: “I can hear his light, tense voice saying as we walked at night, ‘I’m struggling with my picture, I’m beating my brains out, I’m stuck.’”","When beset by his demons, de Kooning would pace the dark streets for most of the night ... walking as far south as Battery Park at the southern tip of the city and then back.

Denby said: “I can hear his light, tense voice saying as we walked at night, ‘I’m struggling with my picture, I’m beating my brains out, I’m stuck.’”<br><br>It was on one such evening that de Kooning, restlessly roaming the streets late at night, first met Mark Rothko, who rarely went to the artists cafés... And so, one night in the park, it was late, wasn’t a soul around. I walked around—thought I would sit a little bit on a bench. I was sitting way on the right side of the bench and kind of a husky man was on the left end of the bench, and I thought maybe I ought to move and sit on another bench. Maybe people would think we were a couple of queers or something. I didn’t know what I was thinking. We were just sitting there—there wasn’t a soul around ... and we just sat there until Mark said something like it was a nice evening. And so I said, “Yes, a nice evening,” and we got to talk.<br>I guess he must’ve asked me what I did. I said, “I’m a painter.” He said, “Oh, you’re a painter? I’m a painter, too.” And he said, “What’s your name?” I said, “I’m Bill de Kooning.” I said, “Who are you?” He says, “I’m Rothko.” I said, “Oh, for God’s sake,” and said it was very funny. Then we talked and a couple of days later he came to visit me in my studio. ",

,126&127,Night Walks,51st St & 3rd Avenue,,Capote,,"Another night, deep in the summer, the heat of my room sent me out into the streets. I walked down Third Avenue to Fifty-first Street, where there was an antique store with an object in its window I admired: a palace of a bird cage, a mosque of minarets and bamboo rooms yearning to be filled with talkative parrots. But the price was three hundred and fifty dollars.","Another night, deep in the summer, the heat of my room sent me out into the streets. I walked down Third Avenue to Fifty-first Street, where there was an antique store with an object in its window I admired: a palace of a bird cage, a mosque of minarets and bamboo rooms yearning to be filled with talkative parrots. But the price was three hundred and fifty dollars. On the way home I noticed a cab-driver crowd gathered in front of P. J. Clark’s saloon, apparently attracted there by a happy group of whiskey- eyed Australian army officers baritoning, “Waltzing Matilda.” As they sang they took turns spin-dancing a girl over the cobbles under the El; and the girl, Miss Golightly, to be sure, floated round in their, arms light as a scarf.

I distinctly remember the smell of cigarettes, alcohol, garbage and cheap perfume. On the way to Keith Haring and Juan Dubose’s cluttered apartment on Broome Street, hookers lined the blocks of Chrystie Street. We always knew that we were near because we could hear the sound of their vinyl hot pants snapping back and forth and their heels clicking.",

,,Night Walks,Washington Square Park ,,Didion ,,"We would watch the sky lighten and have a last drink with no ice and then go home in the early morning light, when the streets were clean and wet (had it rained in the night? we never knew) and the few cruising taxis still had their headlights on and the only color was the red and green of the traffic signals ... I liked the bleak branches above Washington Square at dawn, and the monochromatic flatness of Second Avenue, the fire escapes and the grilled storefronts peculiar and empty in their perspective.",,

This avenue is full of saloons, and they are called just that ... no fancy foreign names like Cocktail Lounges ... So sleep on stranger ... no one will bother you ... not even the cops ... Sunday is a good day for sleeping—so is any other day— when one is tired.",,

,,Night Walks,,,Coribusier,,"The night was dark, the air dry and cold. The whole city was lighted up. If you have not seen it, you cannot know or imagine what it is like. You must have had it sweep over you. Then you begin to understand why Americans have become proud of themselves in the last twenty years ... The sky is decked out. It is a Milky Way come down to earth; you are in it. Each window, each person, is a light in the sky. At the same time a perspective is established by the arrangement of the thousand lights of each skyscraper; it forms itself more in your mind than in the darkness perforated by illimitable fires. The stars are part of it also—the real stars—but sparkling quietly in the distance.",,

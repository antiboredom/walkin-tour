These spaces are refuges, tiny oases, sought after, multipurpose. They are meditative temples. They are moments of rest. Where nothing is happening. These places become little pockets of possibility. They are unidentified, off the grid, the staging areas for trysts, seductions, encounters. They are the places where crimes are committed, of one kind or another. The most conspicuous, hiding-in-plain- sight negative space in New York is Central Park. ",,

To walk among the crowd means never going faster than anyone else, never lagging behind your neighbor, never doing anything to disrupt the flow of human traffic. If you play by the rules of this game, people will tend to ignore you. ","In the streets, everything is bodies and commotion, and like it or not, you cannot enter them without adhering to a rigid protocol of behavior. To walk among the crowd means never going faster than anyone else, never lagging behind your neighbor, never doing anything to disrupt the flow of human traffic. If you play by the rules of this game, people will tend to ignore you. There is a particular glaze that comes over the eyes of New Yorkers when they walk through the streets, a natural and perhaps necessary form of indifference to others. It doesn’t matter how you look, for example. Outrageous costumes, bizarre hairdos, T-shirts with obscene slogans printed across them—no one pays attention to such things. On the other hand, the way you act inside your clothes is of the utmost importance. Odd gestures of any kind are automatically taken as a threat. Talking out loud to yourself, scratching your body, looking someone directly in the eye: these deviations can trigger off hostile and sometimes violent reactions from those around you. You must not swagger or swoon, you must not clutch the walls, you must not sing, for all forms of spontaneous or involuntary behavior are sure to elicit stares, caustic remarks, and even an occasional shove or kick in the shins. I was not so far gone that I received any treatment of that sort, but I saw it happen to others, and I knew that a day might eventually come when I wouldn’t be able to control myself anymore.",

P. McMahon, 2014","The work of Vito Aconcci, a New York-based performance and installation artist, frequently explored the role of individual bodies in public space. Representative of the revolutionary 1960s performance art world, Aconcci's 1969 <i>Following Piece</i> was part of the influential Architectural League of NY's Streetworks, which called 594 Broadway home. In Aconcci's words, ""I am almost not an 'I' anymore; I put myself in the service of this scheme.""","<i>Following Piece</i>, potentially, could use all the time allotted and all the space available: I might be following people, all day long, every day, through all the streets in New York City. In actuality, following episodes ranged from two or three minutes when someone got into a car and I couldn’t grab a taxi, I couldn’t follow—to seven or eight hours—when a person went to a restaurant, a movie.",,

A known haunt for figures such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, James Baldwin, Frank O’Hara and Gore Vidal.","On the San Remo: “The place is an ordinary hash house during the day, serving truckers, garage men, postal clerks, and others who work in the area. At night, the place goes into outer space. By two or three in the morning, there usually isn’t a customer in there who isn’t on something, more likely a combination of somethings, nodding out, speeding, tipping, and, in the case of the reactionaries, just plain drunk.""","On the San Remo: “The place is an ordinary hash house during the day, serving truckers, garage men, postal clerks, and others who work in the area.

<br>On entering, it looked ordinary enough, with groups clustered in booths and others hunched over the counter. Only when I looked at the groups closely did I realize that it was a drug-induced caricature of every other hash house in the country. People were speaking, but they weren’t talking. They were looking at each other, but they weren’t seeing. Their hands and bodies moved, but their selves were motionless. At the core was solitude.”",

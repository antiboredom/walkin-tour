loft on Sixth Avenue. Upon entering, we were astonished to see numerous priceless works of art lining the walls. When we inquired “Is that ... ?” we were unceremoniously cut off and told that everything here is what you think it is. There were Johnses, Rauschenbergs and even a little Duchamp <i>Tzank Check</i> framed in a ’70s plexiglass frame close the floor, covered in cooking grease, dust and cat piss. Over many valuable works of art were leaky skylights. During dinner we asked Merce what would happen if one of these works were damaged. He smiled and said, “But of course our friends would just make us another.”

Rockefeller, Jr. believed, and first expressed in 1941. It reads:<br><br><i>I believe in the supreme worth of the individual and in his right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.<br>

I believe that every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity, an obligation; every possession, a duty.<br>
I believe that the law was made for man and not man for the law; that government is the servant of the people and not their master.<br>
I believe in the Dignity of labor, whether with head or hand; that the world owes no man a living but that it owes every man an opportunity to make a living.<br>
I believe that thrift is essential to well ordered living and that economy is a prime requisite of a sound financial structure, whether in government, business or personal affairs.<br>
I believe that truth and justice are fundamental to an enduring social order.<br>
I believe in the sacredness of a promise, that a man's word should be as good as his bond; that character not wealth or power or position – is of supreme worth.<br>
I believe that the rendering of useful service is the common duty of mankind and that only in the purifying fire of sacrifice is the dross of selfishness consumed and the greatness of the human soul set free.<br>
I believe in an all-wise and all-loving God, named by whatever name, and that the individuals highest fulfilment, greatest happiness, and widest usefulness are to be found in living in harmony with His Will.<br>
I believe that love is the greatest thing in the world; that it alone can overcome hate; that right can and will triumph over might.<br></i>",Rockefeller Center is the fulfillment of the promise of Manhattan. All paradoxes have been resolved.<br><br>From now on the Metropolis is perfect.,"Rockefeller Center is the fulfillment of the promise of Manhattan. All paradoxes have been resolved.<br><br>
From now on the Metropolis is perfect.
<br><br>Beauty, utility, dignity and service are to be combined in the completed project. Rockefeller Center is not Greek, but it suggests the balance of
Greek architecture. It is not Babylonian, but it retains the flavor of Babylon’s magnificence. It is not Roman, yet it has Rome’s enduring qualities of mass and strength. Nor is it the Taj Mahal, which it resembles in mass-composition, though in it has been caught the spirit of the Taj—aloof, generous in space, quieting in its serenity.
<br><br>The Taj Mahal lies in solitary grandeur on the shimmering bank of the Jumna River. Rockefeller Center will stand in the mid-stream rush of New York. The Taj is like an oasis in the jungle, its whiteness tense against the gloomy greenness of the forest. Rockefeller Center will be a beautiful entity in the swirling life of a great metropolis—its cool heights standing out against the agitated man-made skyline. And yet the two, far apart in site and surroundings, are akin in spirit.<br><br>
The Taj, in tribute to pure beauty, was designed as a temple, a shrine. Rockefeller Center, conceived in the same spirit of aesthetic devotion, is designed to satisfy, in pattern and in service, the many-sided spirit of our civilization. By solving its own varied problems, by bringing beauty and business into closer companionship, it promises a significant contribution to the city planning of an unfolding future. ",

Such edifices would be longstanding but noble, such that when they eventually crumbled, a thousand years hence, their broken columns and tumbled-down stone walls would convey a message of glorious achievement followed by decay. ","The Empire State embodies its own kind of technotopian dream: not the genocidal Nazi fantasy, of course, but an extended celebration of machine logic and the forces of capital. The building achieves, in its smooth and hygienic Huxleyan fashion, a totalitarian ideal of command and control, the inexorable logic of assembly line and social engineering. The building is all about vertical space, and in Manhattan’s force-grown grid, space is money: upward is not upward for its own sake, but for the sake of possibility and profit. On the cramped Manhattan street plan, there is nowhere else to go, and so the skyscraper was born. The Empire State’s relation to the grid is therefore symbiotic, born of its pressures but also exploiting its conduits, the streets and pipes and gas lines that tangle beneath its surface. It is a node growing, massing, developing in the entire network of power and commodity, rising like a magic tower from sheer force of energy concentrated below.",,

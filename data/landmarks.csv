be dead. So, I went one night to the top of the Manhattan Bridge, & after a few minutes, I jumped off.” “That’s amazing,” I said. “Yeah,” Tuli said, “but nothing happened. I landed in the water, & I wasn’t dead. So I swam ashore, & went home, & took a bath, & went to bed. Nobody even noticed.”<br><br>The bridge, he said, “emerges victorious,” subjugating the hellish “fluvial abyss” of the torrent beneath.",

Made of cables and steel beams, it gleams in the sky like a reversed arch. It is blessed. It is the only seat of grace in the disordered city.""","In intense cold, the metal framework of the George Washington Bridge contracts, creating a rise of three feet in the roadway, at the center of its span. In hot weather, due to the expansion of its giant cables, the center is twelve feet closer to the Hudson than in mid-winter. ","In intense cold, the metal framework of the George Washington Bridge contracts, creating a rise of three feet in the roadway, at the center of its span. In hot weather, due to the expansion of its giant cables, the center is twelve feet closer to the Hudson than in mid-winter. With its grey lines and trellises, its silver spokes and curving girders, this bridge is like an exquisitely complicated cat’s-cradle of steel that leaps into the immensity. Connecting Manhattan Island with New Jersey, it is one of the most beautiful of man-made objects. To defray the cost of building, fifty cents is charged for crossing the bridge by car, and it cannot but be fortunate that funds ran out before the intended decorations could be added. Its extreme and unpretentious functionalism makes it a supreme example of modern engineering.",

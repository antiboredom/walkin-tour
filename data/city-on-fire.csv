,723,City on Fire,Rockefeller Center,,"<i>Art of the City</i> by Peter Conrad, 1984",,The shadows cast by the El in the streets beneath construct a caging lattice of light; the steel tiers of Rockefeller Center as it rises are a penitentiary. ,"Whereas the spaces of the elderly, childish New York are gardens, even if theyâ€™re rubble-strewn vacant lots or tenement courtyards bedecked with dripping laundry, those of the new New York are jails. The shadows cast by the El in the streets beneath construct a caging lattice of light; the steel tiers of Rockefeller Center as it rises are a penitentiary. The girders trap the steelworkers inside a system of endless repetition, allotting to eacha see-through cell in which to labor. The El projects an illusory prison of barred shadows; Rockefeller Center rearing in the air is a diagrammatic, conceptual prison.",

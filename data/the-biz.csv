,,The Biz,Telegraph = 525 W 52nd St ,,Cohen and Popik,Contested origin...popularized by turf racing reporter John J. Fitz Gerald at the <i>New York Morning Telegraph</i>,"Charles Gillett created the Big Apple tourism campaign, which was conceived during the 1964–65 World’s Fair, and most of the bureau’s publications carried “Come to the Fair” or similar slogans in large type. Gillett proposed that after the Fair, the city was The Big Apple, named after jazz musicians’ nickname for the city because that’s where they’d get the best jobs.",,
,,The Biz,1675 Broadway,,Cracknell,DM B&B,"In the mid-1950s an art director at Benton & Bowles asked the name of the hopeful blonde female illustrator who’d just shown her folio to a colleague in the office next to his. “That wasn’t a chick,” he laughed, “I’ve got his name somewhere ... er ... Andy Warhol.”",,
,,The Biz,E 55th St & Madison Ave,,Gooch,Hugo Gallery = E 55th St & Madison Ave,"O’Hara was vexed by Warhol’s rise. They had both arrived in New York at about the same time. But Warhol’s acceptance by the art world in which O’Hara was so celebrated was peripheral at best. Of Warhol’s first show at the Hugo Gallery in 1952, an unimpressed Art News reviewer had written that his drawings of young boys’ heads and women dressed in the style of the twenties were “airily” reminiscent of the novels of Truman Capote.

1,,The Biz,New York University,,Bockris,"PR course taught by Edward Bernays, nephew of Sigmund Freud","Publicity had not been an issue with artists in the Forties and Fifties. It might come as a bolt from the philistine blue, as when Life made Jackson Pollock famous; but such events were rare enough to be freakish, not merely unusual. By today’s standards, the art world was virginally naive about the mass media and what they could do. Television and the press, in return, were indifferent to what could still be called the avant-garde. “Publicity” meant a notice in the <i>New York Times</i>, a paragraph or two long, followed eventually by an articlein <i>Art News</i> which perhaps five thousand people would read. Anything else was regarded as extrinsic to the work—something to view with suspicion, at best an accident, at worst a gratuitous distraction. One might woo a critic, but not a fashion correspondent, a TV producer, or the editor of <i>Vogue</i>. To be one’s own PR outfit was, in the eyes of the New York artists of the Forties or Fifties, nearly unthinkable—hence the contempt they felt for Salvador Dalí.",,

,,The Biz,DDB = 437 Madison Ave,,Cracknell,Written by Judy Protas at DDB ,"“You don’t have to be Jewish to love Levy’s real Jewish rye.” It was advertised as “Levy’s real Jewish Rye,” itself a little contrived as there’s nothing particularly Jewish about rye bread ... Subway passengers became aware of posters with large, engaging pictures of the people you’d least expect chewing through a hunk of Levy’s. And if they looked authentic, that’s because they were authentic: “We wanted normal-looking people, not blonde, perfectly proportioned models. I saw the Indian on the street; he was an engineer for the New York Central. The Chinese guy worked in a restaurant near my midtown Manhattan office. And the kid we found in Harlem. They have great faces, interesting faces, expressive faces.”<br><br>It would be easy now to dismiss the whole campaign as stereotypical, even condescending, but not then—far from it. These ads were startling for the simple reason that such people weren’t usually seen starring in advertising. New Yorkers reveled in it, demanding copies of the Levy’s posters as well as the bread. It reflected and celebrated their contemporary multiculturalism, and for the immigrants it helped “normalize” their status simply by making them seem an accepted, normal part of society.",,

,312,The Biz,,,Douglas,,"Scott Fitzgerald spent only three months in the advertising world but learned how to drop flamboyantly quotable lines such as: “All women over thirty should be shot.”<br><br>Scott had shrewd ideas about pushing his books. In a 1923 essay entitled “How I Would Sell My Book,” he urged the dealers to fill an entire store window with nothing but copies of his latest book, then station “a man with large spectacles sitting in the midst of them, frantically engrossed in the perusal of a copy.” Brash but incandescent self-promotion was one of the motive springs of young Fitzgerald’s art. “I am a fake,” he liked to explain in a half-conscious homage to the values of Madison Avenue, “but not a lie.”",,

,,The Biz,47th and Broadway,,"Berman, Town",,"Tibor Kalman’s (1949–99) Fire Sign. A spectacular ad for <i>Colors</i>, a glossy magazine put out by the Italian sportswear company United Colors of Benetton. The sign was on display in 1992 and 1993. It was fifty feet high, maybe twice as long; it curved around the corner of 47th Street and Broadway, and it showed full frontal nude photos of six teenagers. Actually, they weren’t quite teenagers: Two of them looked closer to twenty-five, another two seemed more like fifteen. And they weren’t quite nude; they were holding small signs over their genitals, something like the fig leaves in Renaissance paintings of Adam and Eve. It was hard for a spectator not to enjoy the nakedness of these beautiful kids; but their genital fig leaves forced us also to share their embarrassment.<br><br>he color contrasts among the kids were striking: One was clearly Asian, one clearly African (Afro-American? Afro-European?), two clearly Caucasian, and two unclear or mixed; for that matter, it was very likely that all of them were mixed. The contrasts in ideas were striking, too. At the far left, a punklike blond boy with an Axl Rose look held an ATTITUDE placard. Next, a voluptuous Asian girl held RACE. An olive-skinned boy carried a TRUTH sign. A black girl had a POWER sign. A short, compact Asian man signed LIES. At right, the youngest-looking of the six, a girl with a gamine aura, covered herself with FIRST DATE. It was impossible (or let’s say very hard) for a spectator not to enjoy the near nakedness of these kids, to feast our eyes on them. At the same time, the way the sign was crafted, it was impossiblenot to feel guilt and embarrassment. The sudden vision of their bodies was revelatory and shocking. There was something about the way they stood, the ambient light and color, the innocence on their faces when innocence was mixed with defiance—that made them seem vulnerable and overexposed; they looked more like suspects in a police lineup than participants in an orgy. But what was their crime? There was human depth in this sign, it drew usinto the action. Before the picture could mean anything, we spectators had to imagine actively, to “write the book.” My wife and I imagined a strip search after a drug raid on a club. We noticed that at least two of these kids were “underage,” but we couldn’t tell what the age spread was supposed to mean. Was the point that age meant nothing? (But then, I thought, shouldn’t there be some older people with wrinkled or sagging bodies in the scene?) We never figured out their genital signs, fig leaves in print. Were we meant to think of those tags as social labels imposed by the powers that took their clothes and lined them up? Was this a generation of kids caught in the crossfire of adult big words? Yet wasn’t “victim” another adult big word?",,

,310,The Biz,Columbus Circle,,Sanders,,"Like so many others, a young woman named Gladys Glover has come toNew York to make a name for herself. Unable to do so by dint of talent or determination, she hits upon a simpler expedient, using her hard-earned cash to rent a huge billboard overlooking Columbus Circle, with her name painted on it in ten-foot-tall letters. Eerily prophetic in its vision of celebrity as a self-fueling phenomenon—Gladys becomes famous for being famous— offering deep insight into the nature of urban spectacle. New York is a city of crowds, of course, but it is also an instrument by which certain individuals distinguish themselves from the crowd, commanding the attention of everyone else. Incapable of activating New York’s publicity machine in an institutional way, Gladys taps the city’s physical urbanism, which turns out to be shaped along much the same lines: giant signs, placed on buildings facing large public spaces, seek to draw the notice of the thousands of pedestrians below.",,
,,The Biz,23rd St & Broadway,,WPA Guide,,"The phrase, the Great White Way, is supposed to have been coined in 1901 by O.J.

A modest sign at Broadway and Twenty-third Street advertising an ocean resort was New York’s first experience with this phenomenon.",,

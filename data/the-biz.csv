A spectacular ad for <i>Colors</i>, a glossy magazine put out by the Italian sportswear company United Colors of Benetton. The sign was on display in 1992 and 1993. It was fifty feet high, maybe twice as long; it curved around the corner of 47th Street and Broadway, and it showed full frontal nude photos of six teenagers. Actually, they weren’t quite teenagers: Two of them looked closer to twenty-five, another two seemed more like fifteen. And they weren’t quite nude; they were holding small signs over their genitals, something like the fig leaves in Renaissance paintings of Adam and Eve.

And they weren’t quite nude; they were holding small signs over their genitals, something like the fig leaves in Renaissance paintings of Adam and Eve. It was hard for a spectator not to enjoy the nakedness of these beautiful kids; but their genital fig leaves forced us also to share their embarrassment.<br><br>The color contrasts among the kids were striking: One was clearly Asian, one clearly African (Afro-American? Afro-European?), two clearly Caucasian, and two unclear or mixed; for that matter, it was very likely that all of them were mixed. The contrasts in ideas were striking, too. At the far left, a punklike blond boy with an Axl Rose look held an ATTITUDE placard. Next, a voluptuous Asian girl held RACE. An olive-skinned boy carried a TRUTH sign. A black girl had a POWER sign. A short, compact Asian man signed LIES. At right, the youngest-looking of the six, a girl with a gamine aura, covered herself with FIRST DATE. It was impossible (or let’s say very hard) for a spectator not to enjoy the near nakedness of these kids, to feast our eyes on them. At the same time, the way the sign was crafted, it was impossible
not to feel guilt and embarrassment. The sudden vision of their bodies was revelatory and shocking. There was something about the way they stood, the ambient light and color, the innocence on their faces when innocence was mixed with defiance—that made them seem vulnerable and overexposed; they looked more like suspects in a police lineup than participants in an orgy. But what was their crime? There was human depth in this sign, it drew us into the action. Before the picture could mean anything, we spectators had to imagine actively, to “write the book.” My wife and I imagined a strip search after a drug raid on a club. We noticed that at least two of these kids were “underage,” but we couldn’t tell what the age spread was supposed to mean. Was the point that age meant nothing? (But then, I thought, shouldn’t there be some older people with wrinkled or sagging bodies in the scene?) We never figured out their genital signs, fig leaves in print. Were we meant to think of those tags as social labels imposed by the powers that took their clothes and lined them up? Was this a generation of kids caught in the crossfire of adult big words? Yet wasn’t “victim” another adult big word?",

He's referred to in his obituary as ""the father of public relations"" for combining the ideas of Gustave Le Bon and Wilfred Trotter on crowd psychology with the psychoanalytical ideas of his uncle, Sigmund Freud.","Publicity had not been an issue with artists in the Forties and Fifties. It might come as a bolt from the philistine blue, as when Life made Jackson Pollock famous; but such events were rare enough to be freakish, not merely unusual. By today’s standards, the art world was virginally naive about the mass media and what they could do. Television and the press, in return, were indifferent to what could still be called the avant-garde. “Publicity” meant a notice in the <i>New York Times</i>, a paragraph or two long, followed eventually by an articlein <i>Art News</i> which perhaps five thousand people would read. Anything else was regarded as extrinsic to the work—something to view with suspicion, at best an accident, at worst a gratuitous distraction. One might woo a critic, but not a fashion correspondent, a TV producer, or the editor of <i>Vogue</i>. To be one’s own PR outfit was, in the eyes of the New York artists of the Forties or Fifties, nearly unthinkable—hence the contempt they felt for Salvador Dalí.",,

The country’s creativity, he thought, went into its plumbing and its bridges; all art had to do was make selections from its utilitarian stock, as he did when he tagged the Woolworth Building as a ready-made. Because New York was already “a complete work of art,” it absolved Duchamp from the necessity of creating new works of art. Its gift to him was that it silenced him. “I have not painted a single picture since coming over,” he boasted.",,

Eerily prophetic in its vision of celebrity as a self-fueling phenomenon—Gladys becomes famous for being famous— offering deep insight into the nature of urban spectacle. New York is a city of crowds, of course, but it is also an instrument by which certain individuals distinguish themselves from the crowd, commanding the attention of everyone else. Incapable of activating New York’s publicity machine in an institutional way, Gladys taps the city’s physical urbanism, which turns out to be shaped along much the same lines: giant signs, placed on buildings facing large public spaces, seek to draw the notice of the thousands of pedestrians below.",,

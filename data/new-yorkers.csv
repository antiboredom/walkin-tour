He call[ed] it the Bunker."" Bockris, author of <i>Burroughs</i> writes, ""Going to the Bunker can be a hazardous experience, and in fact William personifies more than any other man I have ever met a person aware of the hazards surrounding him. He has recently equipped me with a cane, a tube of tear gas, and a blackjack. 'I would never go out of the house without all three on me,' he says pointedly.""","On an average day in New York, William S. Burroughs gets up between 9:00 and 10:00 and shaves. In a dream note made on 13th August 1975 he wrote: “Things needed. Shaving mirror. Anyone used to shave feels deteriorationif he cannot.” From Retreat Diaries. Burroughs associates shaving with civilization and throughout his travels has never grown a beard or mustache.","On an average day in New York, William S.

Burroughs associates shaving with civilization and throughout his travels has never grown a beard or mustache.<br><br>Then he takes a 100 milligram capsule of vitamin B1 because he believes it replaces the B1 that alcohol removes from the system. He dresses, washes last night’s dishes, and eats breakfast. He likes coffee with a donut, English muffin, or angel food cake.<br><br>Around 11:00 he goes down four long flights of stairs to get his mail (5-10 pieces daily). Between 11:30 and 12:30 he putters around the loft looking at notes, writing notes, and checking through various books.<br><br>Between 12:30 and 1:00 Bill often goes out shopping for groceries or, lately, new clothes. He’s usually back by 1:00, eats no lunch and writes between 1:00 and 4:00 in the afternoon.<br><br>If James Grauerholz is working with him on a manuscript or a reading, James will arrive around 4:00 in the afternoon and will stay through dinner. This happens, on the average, three times a week. They go over the work between 4:00 and 6:00 when Burroughs often relaxes, sitting in a rocking chair by the window. “It’s a very beautiful sight,” James says. “I’ll be working at the other end of the loft. I’ll look up, and there will be William just sitting perfectly still in his chair looking kind of serene.”<br><br>At 6:00 P.M. Burroughs pours himself a drink. Dinner is between 7:30 and 8:30.<br><br>All his life Burroughs has eaten in restaurants. Today, he shops and cooks for himself, often having friends over, or going to their places nearby for dinner. After dinner, conversation continues until 11:00 or 12:00 and then usually home or to bed. Occasionally he stays up talking till dawn.<br><br>An average Burroughs day produces six pages. Sometimes he’ll write as many as fifteen. When he started <i>Cities of the Red Night</i> he produced 120 pages in two weeks. “William’s very good at knowing when to leave things alone and when to go back to them. He knows when enough is enough,” James reports. “Sometimes I may try to push him on something—looking at a manuscript when 600 pages have been written and saying, ‘We should begin editing that’—and he’ll say, ‘No ... that’ll take another couple of years.’ He’s seen enough time pass that he knows how to pace himself.”",

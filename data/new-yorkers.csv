He call[ed] it the Bunker."" Bockris, author of <i>Burroughs</i> writes, ""Going to the Bunker can be a hazardous experience, and in fact William personifies more than any other man I have ever met a person aware of the hazards surrounding him. He has recently equipped me with a cane, a tube of tear gas, and a blackjack. 'I would never go out of the house without all three on me,' he says pointedly.""","On an average day in New York, William S. Burroughs gets up between 9:00 and 10:00 and shaves. In a dream note made on 13th August 1975 he wrote: “Things needed. Shaving mirror. Anyone used to shave feels deteriorationif he cannot.” From Retreat Diaries. Burroughs associates shaving with civilization and throughout his travels has never grown a beard or mustache.","On an average day in New York, William S.

He dresses, washes last night’s dishes, and eats breakfast. He likes coffee with a donut, English muffin, or angel food cake.<br><br>Around 11:00 he goes down four long flights of stairs to get his mail (5-10 pieces daily). Between 11:30 and 12:30 he putters around the loft looking at notes, writing notes, and checking through various books.<br><br>Between 12:30 and 1:00 Bill often goes out shopping for groceries or, lately, new clothes. He’s usually back by 1:00, eats no lunch and writes between 1:00 and 4:00 in the afternoon.<br><br>If James Grauerholz is working with him on a manuscript or a reading, James will arrive around 4:00 in the afternoon and will stay through dinner. This happens, on the average, three times a week. They go over the work between 4:00 and 6:00 when Burroughs often relaxes, sitting in a rocking chair by the window. “It’s a very beautiful sight,” James says. “I’ll be working at the other end of the loft. I’ll look up, and there will be William just sitting perfectly still in his chair looking kind of serene.”<br><br>At 6:00 P.M. Burroughs pours himself a drink. Dinner is between 7:30 and 8:30.<br><br>All his life Burroughs has eaten in restaurants. Today, he shops and cooks for himself, often having friends over, or going to their places nearby for dinner. After dinner, conversation continues until 11:00 or 12:00 and then usually home or to bed. Occasionally he stays up talking till dawn.<br><br>An average Burroughs day produces six pages. Sometimes he’ll write as many as fifteen. When he started <i>Cities of the Red Night</i> he produced 120 pages in two weeks. “William’s very good at knowing when to leave things alone and when to go back to them. He knows when enough is enough,” James reports. “Sometimes I may try to push him on something—looking at a manuscript when 600 pages have been written and saying, ‘We should begin editing that’—and he’ll say, ‘No ... that’ll take another couple of years.’ He’s seen enough time pass that he knows how to pace himself.”",

Yet the place I’d envisioned paled beside the reality—an understandable reaction for me to have, since all I ever knew, all I could compare the city of my dreams with, were dismal suburban sprawls where nobody walks because there’s nothing to see, where there is no spring, summer, fall, or winter, only unchanging days of humdrum sunshine thatlull you into thinking comfort is all that matters in life. Small wonder I was agog over what I instantly recognized as the cosmopolitan atmosphere of a true city, whose want of any hint of provincialism thrilled me to the quick and whose awesome scale, ceaseless roar, and pounding tempo at once stunned, stirred, and seduced me. God, how the place bustled with people and activity! And it was now my home, it was where I should live.",

In front of that luggage store that I never see anybody in. The southwest corner, you know? Everybody pretended like nothing was happening. She had high heels on. (Tuesday, January 21, 1986)",

Price calms down, continues to stare out the cab’s dirty window, probably at the word FEAR sprayed in red graffiti on the side of a McDonald’s on Fourth and Seventh ... Like in a movie another bus appears, another poster for <i>Les Misérables</i> replaces the word—not the same bus because someone has written the word DYKE over Eponine’s face. ",

,86,Stupid Money,Harlem TBD,,Hawes,"Manhattan apartment houses, as we'd recognize them today, were first built in 1869 when 769,000 people lived on the island; by1930 the borough's population had swelled to six million, with 98 percent of residents lived stacked up in these buildings.","It never ceased to astonish me that some of the most luxurious apartments in the world are being constructed in the east and west 80s and 90s, while

","It never ceased to astonish me that some of the most luxurious apartments in the world are being constructed in the east and west 80s and 90s, whilea few hundred yards away fester the slums of Harlem. New Yorkers blinker themselves against this, unless they travel by the commuter trains that slice through the ghetto at high speed. Drivers leaving the city to the north to reach the Westchester suburbs or New England are more likely to speedup one of the riverside highways than drive through Harlem. As long asthe service industries prosper, and the glitter and glamour of the city are constantly refueled by fresh injections of talent and money, Manhattan will continue to gleam and shine and beckon as the prince of cities, welcoming acolytes who can make their contribution to it. That this prosperity and sophistication sours with every step that you take north of 96th Street doesn’t concern affluent New Yorkers. They simply don’t see it.",
,,Stupid Money,5th Ave & 33rd St,,,William Waldorf Astor's Mansion ,"Miss Foley, the Waldorf housekeeper, has over two thousand rooms in her household; with 30,000 face towels and 54,000 sheets in her linen cupboard, her laundry bill must surely be excessive. Each day over 60,000 pieces of linen are sent to the wash. In this vast, modern, efficient hotel, that employs “every possible comfort-bringing, labor-saving device,” it would seem that even used razor-blades must find some utilitarian fate. What becomes of them once they are dropped into those accommodating slots in the bathrooms? Perhaps they reach the world again as part of the steel chassis of a motor-car or add justone more steel drop to the ocean that goes to make a girder, forcing the world higher still to the sky? But no, enquiry reveals that Miss Foley allows the blades to lie idle behind the slots, waiting for the day when the cavities have been filled up before finding a use for the discarded relics.",,

,,Stupid Money,36th St & Madison Ave,,"Ellis, Epic",,"J. Pierpont Morgan dealt himself another hand of solitaire and listened for the twentieth century. It was the night of December 31, 1899, and Morgan sat in the library of his Madison Avenue mansion. Logs crackled in the fireplace. To the left of the hearth stood a bookcase holding two metal statues of knights in armor, a clock perched between them. From time to time Morgan may have lifted his dark-hazel eyes to glance at the clock.<br>The hulking six-foot financier sat at his desk in his usual flat-footed position, toes turned out. With strong and well-formed fingers, he laid out the cards, playing almost automatically, as he did when he had something on his mind. A long cigar protruded from the paper cigar holder clenched in his teeth under his mustache.<br>Although it was almost midnight in Morgan’s mahogany study, it was the high noon of capitalism in America, and no American stood out so starkly as he. Morgan was centralizing the control of industry and credit. He was the capitalist’s capitalist. President William McKinley of the large head and barrel torso sat in the White House; but businessmen guided the nation’s destiny and Morgan guided the businessmen. Indifferent to social reform and defiant of public opinion, Morgan felt that he owed the public nothing.<br>The clock began tolling the hour of midnight. Morgan may have raised his massive head at the very first bing. So the twentieth century had arrived? Very well. Within a little more than a year Morgan was to create the first billion-dollar corporation in history, the United States Steel Corporation.<br> Bong!",,

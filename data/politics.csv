The mayor and his entourage climbed down a ladder at Fourth Avenue and drove through the finish stretch of a pipe that, at a length of 300 miles, was intended to be the largest sewer in the world.

The generous feeling in it was stopped by a rigid perspective, a single center of action, and by jokes with only one side to them. If one overlooked that, what was interesting was the peremptoriness and the paranoia of Marxism as a ferment or method of rhetoric. But artists who looked at painting were used to a brilliance in such a method on the part of the Paris surrealists and to a surrealist humor that the political talk did not have. Politically everybody downtown was anti-fascist, and the talk went on peacefully. Then when friends who had fought in Spain returned, their silence made an impression so direct that the subject was dropped. Against everybody’s intention it had become shameless.
      In the presence of New York at the end of the thirties, the paranoia of surrealism looked parlor-sized or arch. But during the war Bill told me he had been walking uptown one afternoon and at the corner of 53rd and 7th he had noticed a man across the street who was making peculiar gestures in front of his face. It was Breton and he was fighting off a butterfly. A butterfly had attacked the Parisian poet in the middle of New York. So hospitable nature is to a man of genius.",

","Moses' project marked not only a new phase in th emodernization of urban space, but a new breakthrough in modernist vision and thought. For the whole generation of the 1930s--Corbusierian or Bauhaus formalists and technocrats, Marxists, even agrarian neopopulists--these parkways opened up a magical realm, a kind of romantic bower in which modernism and mastorialism could intertwine. Moses seemed to be the one public figure in the world who understood ""the space-time conception of our period""; in addition, he had “the energy and enthusiasm of a Haussmann.” This made him “uniquely equal, as Haussmann himself had been equal, to the opportunities and needs of the period,” and uniquely qualified to build “the city of the future” in our time.

,,Politics,,,Douglas,,"The 1920s were at least as post-Marxist as anti-Marxist. Remember this was the first age of the media, of book clubs, best-sellers, and record charts, of radios and talking pictures; by the end of the decade, one in every three Americans owned a radio and record player, three out of four wentto the movies at least once a week, and virtually no one was out of reachof advertising’s voice. Whatever the moderns’ apathy toward conventional politics, they were altogether alert to the bewildering array of cultural artifacts and phenomena that a full-blown consumer society throws intothe hustling stakes of history. This was the first generation to grasp the supremacy to see that mass culture would acquire, to realize that, in the late- capitalist or consumer society America was becoming, there might not be distinct classes as Marx had explicated them in his studies of early capitalism a half-century earlier; instead of a clear distinction or face-off between the oppressor and the oppressed, there might be only a handy-dandy exchange between what the metropolitans termed “suckers” and “racketeers.” In a consumer society, this generation saw, everyone, wittingly or unwittingly, gets to play the “sucker” one moment and the “racketeer” the next. There are no classes in this shrewdly apolitical political vision, just people more and less deceived. Tricksters and impersonators appeared nightly as top Broadway entertainment; in mongrel Manhattan, con games were culture.",,

It was the night of December 31, 1899, and Morgan sat in the library of his Madison Avenue mansion. Logs crackled in the fireplace. To the left of the hearth stood a bookcase holding two metal statues of knights in armor, a clock perched between them. From time to time Morgan may have lifted his dark-hazel eyes to glance at the clock.The clock began tolling the hour of midnight. Morgan may have raised his massive head at the very first bing. So the twentieth century had arrived? Very well. Within a little more than a year Morgan was to create the first billion-dollar corporation in history, the United States Steel Corporation. Bong!",,

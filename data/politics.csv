","Moses' project marked not only a new phase in th emodernization of urban space, but a new breakthrough in modernist vision and thought. For the whole generation of the 1930s--Corbusierian or Bauhaus formalists and technocrats, Marxists, even agrarian neopopulists--these parkways opened up a magical realm, a kind of romantic bower in which modernism and mastorialism could intertwine. Moses seemed to be the one public figure in the world who understood ""the space-time conception of our period""; in addition, he had “the energy and enthusiasm of a Haussmann.” This made him “uniquely equal, as Haussmann himself had been equal, to the opportunities and needs of the period,” and uniquely qualified to build “the city of the future” in our time. Gegel in 1806 had conceived of Napoleon as ""the <i>Weltseele</i> on a horse""; for Giedion in 1939, Moses liiked like the <i>Weltgeist</i> on wheels.

The generous feeling in it was stopped by a rigid perspective, a single center of action, and by jokes with only one side to them. If one overlooked that, what was interesting was the peremptoriness and the paranoia of Marxism as a ferment or method of rhetoric. But artists who looked at painting were used to a brilliance in such a method on the part of the Paris surrealists and to a surrealist humor that the political talk did not have. Politically everybody downtown was anti-fascist, and the talk went on peacefully. Then when friends who had fought in Spain returned, their silence made an impression so direct that the subject was dropped. Against everybody’s intention it had become shameless.
      In the presence of New York at the end of the thirties, the paranoia of surrealism looked parlor-sized or arch. But during the war Bill told me he had been walking uptown one afternoon and at the corner of 53rd and 7th he had noticed a man across the street who was making peculiar gestures in front of his face. It was Breton and he was fighting off a butterfly. A butterfly had attacked the Parisian poet in the middle of New York. So hospitable nature is to a man of genius.",

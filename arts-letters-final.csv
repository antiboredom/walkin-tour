Between the venues was a single elm tree, known locally as the ""Tree of Hope,"" bringing luck to whoever touched it before taking the stage.

This tradition has it that many years agoâ€”even this date is in doubtâ€”
an unemployed Negro actor stood under the tree, wished for a job, and immediately got it. Thankful, he spread the legend of the power of the tree to get employment for those who stood beneath it and lifted a prayer to its leafy branches. <br>Harlemâ€™s new â€œwishing tree,â€ù larger than a sapling but bare of leaves, thinly branched, and wrapped as bandages, has already begun to carry on. It began yesterday afternoon. â€œWe rubbed that tree and it stopped raining,â€ù announced Bill Robinson, â€œMayorâ€ù of Harlem and tap dancer, into a double row of microphones. The announcement was made just before the new tree was officially â€œplanteâ€ùâ€™ by rhythmic shovelers at 131st Street and Seventh Avenue, near the spot where the old â€œwishing elmâ€ù stood for so many years (some say thirty-five, some say longer).
<br>A now legendary section of the trunk was secured by Ralph Cooper, Sr., a former presenter at the Lafayette Theatre, who was retooling his popular â€œAmateur Nightâ€ù for the stage of the new, more socially progressive, Apollo Theater. The Tree of Hope remains an integral part of the Amateur Night tradition.

New Yorkis particularly difficult; there are no equivalents of Balzac or Dickenswho reached very far toward incorporating into their narratives the vast kaleidoscope of Paris and London. Whether it results from a deficiency in New Yorkâ€™s literary culture or because of the peculiar difficulty of capturing the complexity of New York, the city has not had its Balzac.

His intention was only to embarrass Bonwit Teller by spilling the water, but as he dislodged the tub it slid across the floor, smashed the plate glass, and deluged the sidewalk. DaliÌÅ followed it through the gaping pane to join the crowd on Fifth Avenue. In doing so, he was acting out the forced entry into consciousness which he wanted his irrational images to make. They, too, crave to splinter the glass that flattens and suppresses them, to rebel into a third dimension. They are the interior which vomitously insists on exteriorizing itself. DaliÌÅ was arrested for his pains and remarked that the affair did more for his glory than if heâ€™d devoured Fifth Avenue entire. This constitutes his triumph: a parabolic digestion of the city; a surreal conquest by cannibalism.

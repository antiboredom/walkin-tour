As the clever hopes expire<br>
Of a low dishonest decade:<br>
Waves of anger and fear<br>
Circulate over the bright <br>
And darkened lands of the earth,<br>
Obsessing our private lives;<br>
The unmentionable odour of death<br>
Offends the September night.<br>

Unearth the whole offence<br>

Do evil in return. <br>

Exiled Thucydides knew<br>
All that a speech can say<br>
About Democracy,<br>
And what dictators do,<br>
The elderly rubbish they talk<br>

Analysed all in his book,<br>
The enlightenment driven away,<br>

Cling to their average day:<br>
The lights must never go out,<br>
The music must always play,<br>

To make this fort assume<br>
The furniture of home;<br>
Lest we should see where we are,<br>
Lost in a haunted wood,<br>
Children afraid of the night<br>
Who have never been happy or good.<br>

What mad Nijinsky wrote<br>
About Diaghilev<br>
Is true of the normal heart;<br>
For the error bred in the bone<br>
Of each woman and each man<br>
Craves what it cannot have,<br>
Not universal love<br>
But to be loved alone.<br>
<br><br>
From the conservative dark<br>
Into the ethical life<br>
The dense commuters come,<br>
Repeating their morning vow;<br>
“I will be true to the wife,<br>
I’ll concentrate more on my work,""<br>
And helpless governors wake<br>
To resume their compulsory game:<br>
Who can release them now,<br>
Who can reach the deaf,<br>
Who can speak for the dumb?<br>

All I have is a voice<br>
To undo the folded lie,<br>
The romantic lie in the brain<br>
Of the sensual man-in-the-street<br>
And the lie of Authority<br>
Whose buildings grope the sky:<br>
There is no such thing as the State<br>
And no one exists alone;<br>
Hunger allows no choice<br>
To the citizen or the police;<br>
We must love one another or die.<br>

Defenceless under the night<br>
Our world in stupor lies;<br>
Yet, dotted everywhere,<br>
Ironic points of light<br>
Flash out wherever the Just<br>

Of Eros and of dust,<br>

Negation and despair,<br>
Show an affirming flame.<br>

He is sure that he has done as well, if not better, than most of the boys who loiter around Forty-second Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, a street known by homosexuals as the “Meat Market.” Here hoodlum homosexuals meet prospective customers and arrange the details of payment, the form of sex play, and the place where it is to occur. Santos says that his usual fee is $1. On one evening he took in as much as $6 for three sexual experiences.

A few flagrantly exhibitionistic fairies are able to make a living through the sexual gratification of men who are interested in their type of service. Ordinarily, however, the hustler is the one who is paid by the “queen,” “bitch,” “fag,” or “fairy”—that is, by an effeminate exhibitionist who not only brazenly proclaims his homosexuality to the interested, but attempts to force it on the notice of others. Like the female prostitute, the effeminate male prostitute has a more masculine male prostitute somewhere in the offing to whom he contributes and who serves as his protector. Sometimes these protectors are gangsters. Emotional attachments between fairies of Santos’ type and their protectors are ephemeral affairs.

One man who had indicated his interest in meeting another might stop before a window and gaze at the display; the second could then join him and strike up a conversation in which they could determine whether they wanted to spend more time together. “Fairies hang out in the saloon opposite Bloomingdale’s,” a Macy’s saleswoman claimed in 1913, and, she added, the blocks of Third Avenue in the East Fifties, a marginal retail strip under the El, were “their favorite beat.” A study of arrests for homosexual activity in 1921 provides further evidence of the extent to which cruising was concentrated in retail shopping districts, for it revealed that the subway stations at Lexington and Fifty-ninth Street where Bloomingdale’s stood, Union Square (the site of numerous cheap retail outlets), and Herald Square where Macy’s, Gimbels, and Saks-34th Street were located, each accounted for more arrests than any other station, all together accounted for three-quarters of the arrests reported for all subway stations."

—Gore Vidal, 1946<br><br>


The Astor Bar in Times Square was easily the city's most exciting meeting place for soldiers, sailors, and marines on the prowl for one another; few civilians, and no woman, ever dared intrude on these male mysteries. Even the military police and the shore patrol kept their distance. After all, we had - all of us - won the great imperial war, and thanks to us, the whole world was briefly American. . . .
 <br>
I got to know [Alfred C.] Kinsey in 1948 - his book came out a month after The City and the Pillar; and the shocked New York Times would not advertise either. For a time, Dr. Kinsey used the mezzanine of the Astor as a sort of office, where he would interview ""human males"" about their sex lives. I think that the somewhat phlegmatic Dr. Kinsey was secretly delighted by this warrior display, and I like to think that it was by observing the easy trafficking at the Astor that he figured out what was obvious to most of us, though as yet undreamed of by American society at large: Perfectly ""normal"" young men, placed outside the usual round of family and work, will run riot with each other. <br>

Dances were held there on Saturday nights as a manifest of “Our Place” as opposed to the Mafia-run gay bars in other parts of the city. For two dollars’ admission one could spend an evening immersed in tribal rites, with all the soda or beer one could drink. The street floor of the firehouse was the dance floor, with a circular staircase the Second-floor lounge and soda bar. The basement in Stygian darkness, included chairs, tables, and another soda bar.
<br><br>						
The whole building, on Saturday nights, pulsed with the beat of rock music, but the main action was on the dance floor. When Lamont, Vernon, Michael, and I were going over there, it was early June, 1971, and hot, since the Firehouse didn’t have air conditioning. The higher the temperature went, the more clothes came off, down to the briefest of hot pants. The music blasted. The bodies writhed. The sweat poured. And the beat went on. Observing the melee from halfway up the circular staircase left no doubt in my mind about what was happening. It was a war dance. The contrast to the dancing at Christopher’s End and other dance bars was obvious. At the bars dancing was, by and large, part of the whole cruising process and had a sense of display about it. People danced for other people to see them and hopefully appreciate what they saw. Although plenty of cruising went on at the Firehouse, the dance floor wasn’t the place for peacock displays, but a celebration of post-Stonewall identity. “We are. We are together. And if you don’t like it, fuck off.” "

The first floor was the entrance, the second contained offices, the third the lockers; the next three floors housed the “rooms” and a TV room and gym; the floor above consisted of a communal shower and sauna; up more stairs to the Truck Stop, and the top floor contained so-called Fantasy Rooms.
<br><br>					
If “baths” is a misnomer, so is “rooms.” They were no more than cubicles, a double row of them encircled by a corridor, at least 30 on each floor. On the outer side of the corridor was blank wall—no windows anywhere, one was boxed in, secluded, secure—and the occasional uninviting lavatory and washroom. A cubicle was only large enough for a mattress and a chair. Most of the doors were closed, either because the tenant was busy elsewhere or because the room was occupied by a couple at work.

But some of the doors were open. In some cubicles the dim light exhibited a man languidly staring out into the corridor while he fondled his penis or otherwise displayed his best features to those who passed by.

Although these sexual invitations are transparent enough, they are not of course entirely open. The prospective partner lingers on the threshold and the two men look each other over and decide whether or not to commit unnatural acts. The succession of opening and closing doors implied considerable sexual athleticism, a determination to cram in as many sex acts as your body can take and muster. The silence in the air was punctuated with the grunts and cries of the compatible, but was also filled with the stillness of the undesired, hopelessly exhibiting their negligible charms to a parade of passers-by. In odd recesses stood couples of more exhibitionist inclination. One youth, with an ineffably bored expression, leaned against the wall gazing down onto the mobile head of another man who was energetically sucking him off. It spoke of a vast sexual indifference that was, if anything, more dispiriting than the meat market around the cubicles. Look on, stranger, I’m only making love.

The negro homosexuals still appear at intervals dressed in a baffling impersonation of their opposite sex. Sometimes a “Drag” (or costume ball) is announced ... The raised stubble of chin and neck is pitted with a power that creates a blue bloom. The row of pearls accentuates, rather than camouflages, the Adam’s apple. Kid gloves cover the veined hands, but the feet are always a “give-away.”

Voguing evolved into a contorted, jerky, slicing style of dance when drag queens incorporated kung fu aesthetics into their routines, having become familiar with the swift, angular movements of Bruce Lee and his co-stars while working trade inside Times Square’s porn cinemas, or heading there after a night’s work to get some rest.				
<br><br>
In broad daylight, voguers headed to the abandoned stretches of the West Side piers, where they would hang out and practice moves, or to the clandestine space of gay-driven dance venues such as Better Days, the Paradise Garage and Tracks.

In the early 1980s, leaving my house to go to balls at 3:30am was really just a bit too much. My family argued with me about going out, they were like, “Are you crazy? Where you going at this time?” And I would reply, “I’m leaving Brooklyn, riding the West Side Highway up to Harlem, looking at the sunrise, and then I’m going to a ball.” It was like a drug, you had to go, and you had to wait to the end for the grand prize. It was like, “You have to see Miss Avis come out there, honey.”
<br><br>					
Not because I didn’t appreciate the Harlem Renaissance or my roots, I just didn’t like that 4 o’clock, 5 o’clock in the morning lifestyle. It almost felt to
me like it was as if gay people shouldn’t be seen, so let’s go out in the wee hours of the morning and play around and do our thing, then run home before people can see us. I think it was a little safer for some of the drag queens back then, because they liked coming out when it was dark. But when they came downtown, I picked an area where people could feel safe, wear their fur coats and didn’t have to worry about this, that and the other.
<br><br>					
I walked in Brooklyn, in the worst neighborhoods, in red leather pants, red leather shoes, beige sheepskin, beige shoes, finger-wave hairstyle and Gazelle glasses.

","Let’s suppose you are in a real city and you are a man and you are walking down the street, in the thick of the crowd. Glancing up from the pavement, for just a moment, you notice a man walking in your direction and he’s staring straight at you. Not every man fixes his stare before his feet at this violet
hour, it seems. You don’t. His stare hits you right between your eyes. And not for the first time. You recognize him. He has looked at you in this way before—and he has seen you see him do this before. Let’s say he is about your age (whatever age that is) and he is wearing a suit, like you. You two could be twins, in the dark.
<br><br>			
You don’t know why, or rather, you don’t at this particular moment ask yourself why, but you hold the gaze of this man who is now walking closer
to you and who refuses not to look. Seconds pass, perhaps as many as five
or six, but it seems like longer. Time slows down for you, as it always does in situations like these. In an instant, the gaze between you two is broken—you look down, or perhaps he looks away. Maybe someone passes between you, or something else diverts your attention. It’s noisy, with the sound of horns and motors, but it could be anything. As quickly as the moment came upon you,
it is lost. Almost. You look back, behind you, and see that he, too, is looking back behind him.	
<br><br>	
You are hurrying ... in order to catch a train because you have a family to go home to, a ready-made microwave meal awaits, probably kids, the lot. You don’t want to be late, not again, not again this week anyway. You look forward to your train journey, because this is your time, your very own time, the time between two lives, someone might say.
<br><br>							
On the train home, settled into your seat, and for reasons you cannot explain to yourself or for reasons you really don’t understand, the man on the street—your man on the street, handsome with a nice suit—comes back into your mind. He was never very far out of your mind, if truth be told. You are going a little red in the cheeks at the thought of it, even now. Did you go red in the cheeks when he was looking at you? Was it the blush of shame or the blush of desire? Do you know the difference between shame and desire? These are questions you could ask yourself, but don’t.
<br><br>							
Instead, you wonder if one day this man will speak to you. Speak to me, you think. Why do you never speak? What are you thinking? I never know what you are thinking.
<br><br>							
Can we talk about a network of cruisers rather than occasional and seemingly isolated, if not accidental, encounters?
<br><br>							
While walking the street, my gaze would be riveted on stalwart adolescents, and I would have to look back at the handsomest that passed. If a street-
car conductor happened to be youthful and good-looking, I became almost irrational. With a look of despair I would gaze insolently and imploringly into the face of the blue-clad youth as if I would compel him to read my thoughts, since I did not dare give them expression. When in a crowded car he brushed against me in passing, a tremor would pass over my body. Youthful policemen also at this time particularly fascinated me. Blue clothing and brass buttons have always made a young man appear to me as at his best.
<br><br>							
“So we are taking off our masks, are we, and keeping / our mouths shut? As if we’d been pierced by a glance”—that later leads us to “the merits of each / of the latrines. 14th Street is drunken and credulous, / 53rd tries to tremble but is too at rest.”
<br><br>							
What does it mean when two men look at each other in the streets of the modern city?
<br><br>							
Mere eye contact and an exchange of words.
<br><br>							
Reciprocal gazes may hold their own pleasures for some, and the dynamics of the gaze may be erotic and stimulating precisely because it does not end in sex.
<br><br>							
This chance encounter—“the magnetism of our meeting.” The cruiser queers the flâneur.
<br><br>							
Cruising is a practice that exploits the ambivalence of the modern city, and in so doing, “queers” the totalizing narratives of modernity, in particular, flânerie.
<br><br>							
There’s an art to cruising and it has a lot to do with timing and with the eyes. Take eyes first. You’re walking down the street and you pass a man going in the opposite direction. Your eyes lock but you both keep on moving. After
a few paces you glance back and see that the man has stopped and is facing a store window but looking in your direction. If he’s not exactly the partner you’re searching for you’ll probably register the compliment his stare is paying you but leave it at that.
<br><br>							
But if he does catch your fancy you may go through the little charade
of examining the shop window nearest you. After a bit, the frequency and intensity of exchanged glances will increase and one of you will stroll over to the other. There are a few safe and stock opening lines banal to the point of absurdity ... After these preliminaries you may extend your hand, introduce yourself, ask him his name and suggest you have a drink together. "

581,Brooklyn Bridge,Monuments,,Conrad,,"Crane writes of “the ecstasy of walking hand in hand across the most beautiful bridge of the world, the cables enclosing us and pulling us upward in such a dance ... ”","Crane writes of “the ecstasy of walking hand in hand across the most beautiful bridge of the world, the cables enclosing us and pulling us upward in such a dance ...""<br><br>In 1924 Crane removed himself to Columbia Heights, where he could be at a meditative distance from the city. Now, instead of living in it and being spent by it, he could look at it and understand it from afar. Across the river, it has receded into an image; between himself and it he has placed the Brooklyn Bridge, “the most superb piece of construction in the modern world,” as he called it, which engenders or engineers that image. The bridge suggestsa reconstruction of himself. The valor of structural steel is its resilient preparedness for stress and tension, the inner ailments (as Crane discovered when abraded by New York) of modernity. In its combination of stone piers and steel cables, the bridge dramatizes a change in architectural physiology. There’s a difference in building materials between strength and stress, between plastic and elastic deformation. Iron is strong but breaks easily and can’t be pulled about. It has to be cast or molded, fixed into a solid shape. But if you add carbon, you change the properties of iron and make steel, which is tensile and abides stress. Engineering is the calculated application of stressto a material. Steel is manipulable, and if you know it must withstand a certain stress, you can ensure that it will do so. It copes by flexing, by giving slightly, like the upper tiers of the Empire State swaying in a gale. The cables on the bridge are examples of those contrary “pull forces” that John Mann saw asthe dynamics of cubism. Under pressure from both ends at once, they’re stressed to maintain form despite that tug-of-war. Rather than snapping, they bend, because the big cords are woven of smaller ones which cooperate in the chore. When in 1930 Crane was commissioned by <i>Fortune</i> magazine to write about the construction of the George Washington Bridge, it was the plaiting of these cables which most impressed him."

It’s not a weighted, completed, obstructive thing, but a field of forces distributed through space. Not planted in earth, it unfolds in air, and the logic of its design suggests a similar engineering of society and history: man would be released from his servitude to material forces if only those forces could be operated on, directed, articulated. The bridge is built in time as much as in space. It’s a passage into the future as well as a conduit across a river. Mayakovsky sees it as a prehensile predator, standing with one steel leg in Manhattan while extending a paw to grip Brooklyn. <br><br>He adopts the bridge’s own method of segmenting in his poetic punctuation. Mayakovsky experimented with a punctuation that would array sentences in space, rather than hastening them through time toward a dying fall, with every comma an expression of reserve or hesitancy, every full
stop an obsequy; and this new punctuation, stepped or tiered or zigzagging, works like the bridge, whose cables divide New York in order to rule it.<br><br>If the Eiffel Tower stays too long in wanton Paris, it will, he fears,
get flabby and sell out to the frivolous values of Montmartre. Traveling home across the Atlantic in 1925, he worries about the same mechanical dysfunction in himself. He has been estranged from his activist purpose while abroad and feels himself to be tarnished, corroded: “steel words rust, blacken copper brass. why is it, under foreign rain, I get wet, and rot and rust?”<br><br>From Mayakovsky's 1925 poem ""BrooklynBridge"": <br><br>so I,<br>in graying evening<br>haze, humbly set foot<br>on Brooklyn Bridge. <br>As a conqueror presses<br>into a city<br>all shattered,<br> so, I<br>from the near skies<br> bestrewn with stars,<br>gaze<br>at New York<br>through the Brooklyn Bridge.<br> New York,<br>heavy and stifling<br> till night,<br>has forgotten<br> its hardships<br>and height; <br>and only<br>the household ghosts <br>ascend<br>in the lucid glow of its windows.<br> Here<br>the elevateds<br> drone softly.<br>And only<br> their gentle<br>droning<br> tell us:<br>here trains<br>are crawling and rattling<br>like dishes<br>being cleared in a cupboard."

Almost hidden in the corner between the walls of the church and the sacristy, they’re nearly always in shadow.

Ignore the skyscrapers (easily done from there) and you see something that would have been there in 1700.

54,TBD,,,Sanders,,"The skyline view is a kind of proscenium, after all, a metaphoric arch framing everything to come, offering a reassuring familiarity even as it plunges us into a new and unpredictable experience.","The skyline view is a kind of proscenium, after all, a metaphoric arch framing everything to come, offering a reassuring familiarity even as it plunges us into a new and unpredictable experience. How many places are as widely (or instantly) recognizable as New York? Older films sometimes placed a printed title across the view; newer ones rarely do—but in any case the name has always been superfluous. Like Big Ben or the Taj Mahal, the New York skyline is one of the world’s unmistakable icons, thanks in large part to films themselves: each new opening shot trades on—and reinforces—the skyline’s preexisting fame. Unlike those other icons, though, the skyline carries civic as well as national significance, standing for a city as much as (or more than) a country. And unlike the others it is not just a single structure but an entire place—the very thing, in fact, being symbolized. The Eiffel Tower denotes Paris; the skyline not only denotes but is New York.<br><br>Of course, the skyline also denotes something else: the “big city,” the endless metropolis. This turns out to be less a function of the skyline’s vertical thrust, surprisingly, than its horizontal spread: its hundreds upon hundreds of buildings, with their thousands upon thousands of windows— each window providing the symbolic marker of an individual and so, by extension, an individual story. Over the next few hours, the skyline vista suggests, we will follow one such story—but we might well have turned to some other window and there found another, equally interesting story to watch. Next time, perhaps. There are, the skyline proposes, millions of stories to choose from—a whole city of stories, all proceeding at once, whether we happen to see them or not.<br><br>Some establishing shots try for more, searching the skyline for clues about the story to come. The image that starts <i>Young Man with a Horn</i> (1950) gazes high up at the Chrysler Building, soaring into the sky as confidently as the jazz trumpeter on the soundtrack rises into his upper register. But soon the camera begins to tilt down, descending roof by roof to the modest tenement apartment of piano player Hoagy Carmichael, the film’s narrator. This turns out to be a sketch of the film itself—a struggle between the transcendent “high note” that cornetist Kirk Douglas dreams of reaching and the worldly complexities of life and love that threaten to wreck his career. An identical shot, opening <i>Miracle in the Rain</i> (1956), offers a simpler meaning: New York, as the narrator tells us, is home to not only the high and mighty (the skyscrapers) but to millions of ordinary people—including Jane Wyatt, a tenement dweller who is the film’s romantic lead. Barbara Stanwyck’s smoky voice—over at the opening of 1949’s “East Side, West Side” “Yes, this is my town ... the most exciting city in the world, they say, the (glamorous, the most frightening, and above all, the fastest ... ”) underpins a glide from the sleek towers of midtown to a modest apartment house on Gramercy Park (“for me, it’s home”), again evoking the distinction between the celebrated and the ordinary—and the city’s embrace of both.<br><br>The same kind of movement is elsewhere turned to very different purpose. Among other things, the New York skyline remains an abiding symbol
of American wealth and power; an opening that shifts from the gleaming spires to a slum district effectively reminds the audience that the wretched conditions they will be sharing over the next few hours are to be found not in some obscure locality but in proximity to a national landmark. Over time, the simple tilt or pan from proud skyscrapers in the distance to shabby tenements nearby (in <i>Street Scene</i>, 1931, and <i>The Window</i>, 1949) has given way to the ambitious, planimetric aerial shots that open <i>West Side Story</i> (1961) and <i>
New Jack City</i> (1991), which, surveying all part of New York from above—as
if through a giant microscope—imply a kind of social-science objectivity, linking the city’s riches and poorest districts in a single socioeconomic system. "

It will cost $1,500,000 to erect. The public is urged to invest. The stock will pay 100 percent interest annually. The most voluminous building ever proposed in the history of mankind, it combines in a single gestalt the opposites—needle and sphere, Trylon and Perisphere—that have been the extremes of Manhattan’s formal vocabulary ever since the Latting Observatory and the balloon of the Crystal Palace were juxtaposed in 1853. It is impossible for a globe to be a tower. A sketch illustrating the ad—of a skyline dominated by a blob—reveals the Globe Tower’s concept: the sphere is to be so colossal that simply by resting on the earth it can claim—through the height of its enormous diameter—also tobe a tower, for it is at least “three times as high as the Flatiron building, the present marvel of New York.”"

And yet the two, far apart in site and surroundings, are akin in spirit.<br><br>
The Taj, in tribute to pure beauty, was designed as a temple, a shrine. Rockefeller Center, conceived in the same spirit of aesthetic devotion, is designed to satisfy, in pattern and in service, the many-sided spirit of our civilization.
